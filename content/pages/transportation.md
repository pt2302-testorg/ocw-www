[Transportation@MIT](http://transportation.mit.edu/) is a coordinated effort to address one of civilization's most pressing challenges: the environmental impact of the world's ever-increasing demand for transportation.

Hundreds of MIT faculty members work in areas related to transportation, from motor vehicles to urban infrastructure planning to aviation efficiency to adaptive technologies and their influence on personal behavior.

The Transportation@MIT initiative knits together the wide-ranging, robust research already under way at the Institute and creates new opportunities for education and innovation.
