Massachusetts Institute of Technology has always been associated with major scientific and technological breakthroughs. But the breakthroughs alone do not explain the impact that MIT has had on the world. For that we have to look at entrepreneurship, which starts with the "Mens et Manus" (Mind and Hand) slogan on the Great Seal of MIT. For faculty, students, and alumni, MIT is all about making discoveries and inventions and then applying these discoveries and inventions to solve real problems. In a very tangible way, MIT faculty and graduates invent the future, and entrepreneurship—the building of new businesses—is often the road to that future.

[Watch this video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkDqpBctfA) to entrepreneurship at MIT.

The report “[Entrepreneurship and Innovation at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf)” examines the impact of MIT graduates who have founded and built for-profit companies. The report estimates that, as of 2014, living MIT alumni have launched more than 30,000 active companies, creating some 4.6 million jobs and generating $1.9 trillion in annual revenue. The cumulative result is the equivalent of the 10th largest economy in the world. This rich legacy of high-impact companies spans a wide range of industries; recent examples include A123 Systems, Akamai, iRobot, InVivo Therapeutics and Dropbox.
