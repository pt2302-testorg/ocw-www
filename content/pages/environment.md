Like so many of the big challenges taken on at MIT, environmental issues demand an interdisciplinary perspective.

From declining fisheries to acute urban pollution to record-breaking global temperatures, the evidence of human impact on the environment continues to mount. And at the same time, the environment shapes us, as human society and institutions are built upon our connection to the weather, land, water, and other species. What can we learn from ecological systems and cycles? What are the right solutions to our urgent environmental challenges?

MIT scholars, students and alumni are working to understand and help us make progress toward a more sustainable and just world. This core mission draws upon all of the fields represented at MIT: not just science, engineering, and technology, but also the humanities, arts, economics, history, architecture, urban planning, management, policy, and more.

Use OCW materials from across these fields to expand your horizons and learn more about our relationship with the environment. The course list below is particularly inspired by two interdisciplinary MIT programs. Many of the undergraduate courses fall within the [undergraduate Environment and Sustainability Minor](http://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/environment-sustainability-minor/) devised by MIT’s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI); the OCW course list employs the undergraduate minor’s four topic pillars. Many of the graduate-level courses are part of the [MIT Sloan School of Management Sustainability Certificate](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate) curriculum.
