course_description: 'This seminar explores approaches to representation for distributed
  cinematic storytelling. The relationship between story creation and story appreciation
  is analyzed. Readings are drawn from literary and cinematic criticism, as well as
  from descriptions of interactive, distributed works. Students analyze a range of
  storytelling techniques; they develop a proposal using visualization techniques;
  and they prototype a working story experience, culminating in a final project displayed
  at the end of the semester.
