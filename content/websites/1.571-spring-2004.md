course_description: 'This course uses computer-based methods for the analysis of large-scale
  structural systems. Topics covered include: modeling strategies for complex structures;
  application to tall buildings, cable-stayed bridges, and tension structures; introduction
  to the theory of active structural control; design of classical feedback control
  systems for civil structures; and simulation studies using customized computer software.
