course_description: "Welcome to 2.007! This course is a first subject in engineering\
  \ design. With your help, this course will be a great learning experience exposing\
  \ you to interesting material, challenging you to think deeply, and providing skills\
  \ useful in professional practice. A major element of the course is design of a\
  \ robot to participate in a challenge that changes from year to year. This year,\
  \ the theme is cleaning up the planet as inspired by the movie _Wall-E_.\n\nFrom\
  \ its beginnings in 1970, the 2.007 final project competition has grown into an\
  \ Olympics of engineering.\_ See this [MIT News story](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/timeline-2007-0209.html)\
  \ for more background, a photo gallery, and videos about this course.\n"
