course_description: 'Why has it been easier to develop a vaccine to eliminate polio
  than to control influenza or AIDS? Has there been natural selection for a ''language
  gene''? Why are there no animals with wheels? When does ''maximizing fitness'' lead
  to evolutionary extinction? How are sex and parasites related? Why don''t snakes
  eat grass? Why don''t we have eyes in the back of our heads? How does modern genomics
  illustrate and challenge the field?


  This course analyzes evolution from a computational, modeling, and engineering perspective.
  The course has extensive hands-on laboratory exercises in model-building and analyzing
  evolutionary data.
