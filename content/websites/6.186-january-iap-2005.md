course_description: 'MASLab (Mobile Autonomous System Laboratory), also known as 6.186,
  is a robotics contest. The contest takes place during MIT''s Independent Activities
  Period and participants earn 6 units of P/F credit and 6 Engineering Design Points.
  Teams of three to four students have less than a month to build and program sophisticated
  robots which must explore an unknown playing field and perform a series of tasks.


  MASLab provides a significantly more difficult robotics problem than many other
  university-level robotics contests. Although students know the general size, shape,
  and color of the floors and walls, the students do not know the exact layout of
  the playing field. In addition, MASLab robots are completely autonomous, or in other
  words, the robots operate, calculate, and plan without human intervention. Finally,
  MASLab is one of the few robotics contests in the country to use a vision based
  robotics problem.
