course_description: 'This course provides Mechanical Engineering students with an
  awareness of various responses exhibited by solid engineering materials when subjected
  to mechanical and thermal loadings; an introduction to the physical mechanisms associated
  with design-limiting behavior of engineering materials, especially stiffness, strength,
  toughness, and durability; an understanding of basic mechanical properties of engineering
  materials, testing procedures used to quantify these properties, and ways in which
  these properties characterize material response; quantitative skills to deal with
  materials-limiting problems in engineering design; and a basis for materials selection
  in mechanical design.
