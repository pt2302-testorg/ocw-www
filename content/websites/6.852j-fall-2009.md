course_description: 'Distributed algorithms are algorithms designed to run on multiple
  processors, without tight centralized control. In general, they are harder to design
  and harder to understand than single-processor sequential algorithms. Distributed
  algorithms are used in many practical systems, ranging from large computer networks
  to multiprocessor shared-memory systems. They also have a rich theory, which forms
  the subject matter for this course.


  The core of the material will consist of basic distributed algorithms and impossibility
  results, as covered in Prof. Lynch''s book _Distributed Algorithms_. This will be
  supplemented by some updated material on topics such as self-stabilization, wait-free
  computability, and failure detectors, and some new material on scalable shared-memory
  concurrent programming.
