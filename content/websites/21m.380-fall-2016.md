course_description: 'This course is an introduction to music recording and audio production
  from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. Learn about the physical nature
  and human perception of sound, how it is transformed to and from electrical signals
  by means of microphones and loudspeakers, and how it can be creatively modeled through
  mixing consoles, signal processors, and digital audio workstations. The course covers
  making informed choices about microphone selection and positioning, and various
  editing, mixing, and mastering techniques.
