  developed over the past 115 years. The anthology and supplemental listening will
  present a range of art music aesthetics in a variety of genres such as chamber music,

  importance of a wide diversity of compositional orientations, including Expressionism,
  Impressionism, atonality, neo-Classicism, serialism, nationalism, the influence
  of jazz and popular idioms, post-tonality, electronic music, aleatory, performance
  art, post-modernism, minimalism, spectralism, the New Complexity, neo-Romanticism,
