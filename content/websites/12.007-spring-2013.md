course_description: 'This course introduces the parallel evolution of life and the
  environment. Life processes are influenced by chemical and physical processes in
  the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. In turn, life can influence
  chemical and physical processes on our planet. This course explores the concept
  of life as a geological agent and examines the interaction between biology and the
  earth system during the roughly 4 billion years since life first appeared.
