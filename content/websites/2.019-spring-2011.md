course_description: 'This course covers the complete cycle of designing an ocean system
  using computational design tools for the conceptual and preliminary design stages.
  Students complete the projects in teams with each student responsible for a specific
  subsystem. Lectures cover such topics as hydrodynamics; structures; power and thermal
  aspects of ocean vehicles; environment, materials, and construction for ocean use;
  and generation and evaluation of design alternatives. The course focuses on innovative
  design concepts chosen from high-speed ships, submersibles, autonomous vehicles,
  and floating and submerged deep-water offshore platforms. Lectures on ethics in
  engineering practice are included, and instruction and practice in oral and written
  communication is provided.
