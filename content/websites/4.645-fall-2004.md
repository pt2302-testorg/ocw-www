course_description: 'This class is a general study of modern architecture as a response
  to important technological, cultural, environmental, aesthetic, and theoretical
  challenges after the European Enlightenment. It focuses on the theoretical, historiographic,
  and design approaches to architectural problems encountered in the age of industrial
  and post-industrial expansion across the globe, with specific attention to the dominance
  of European modernism in setting the agenda for the discourse of a global modernity
  at large. It explores modern architectural history through thematic exposition rather
  than as a simple chronological succession of ideas.
