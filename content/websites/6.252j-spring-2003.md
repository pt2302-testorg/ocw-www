course_description: '6.252J is a course in the department''s "Communication, Control,
  and Signal Processing" concentration. This course provides a unified analytical
  and computational approach to nonlinear optimization problems. The topics covered
  in this course include: unconstrained optimization methods, constrained optimization
  methods, convex analysis, Lagrangian relaxation, nondifferentiable optimization,
  and applications in integer programming. There is also a comprehensive treatment
  of optimality conditions, Lagrange multiplier theory, and duality theory. Throughout
  the course, applications are drawn from control, communications, power systems,
  and resource allocation problems.
