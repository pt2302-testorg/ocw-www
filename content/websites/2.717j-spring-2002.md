course_description: 'This course concerns the theory and practice of optical methods
  in engineering and system design, with an emphasis on diffraction, statistical optics,
  holography, and imaging. It provides the engineering methodology skills necessary
  to incorporate optical components in systems serving diverse areas such as precision
  engineering and metrology, bio-imaging, and computing (sensors, data storage, communication
  in multi-processor systems). Experimental demonstrations and a design project are
  included.
