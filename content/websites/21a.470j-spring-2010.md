course_description: 'This course explores stereotypes associated with Asian women
  in colonial, nationalist, state-authoritarian, and global/diasporic narratives about
  gender and power. Students will read ethnography, cultural studies, and history,
  and view films to examine the politics and circumstances that create and perpetuate
  the representation of Asian women as dragon ladies, lotus blossoms, despotic tyrants,
  desexualized servants, and docile subordinates. Students are introduced to the debates
  about Orientalism, gender, and power.
