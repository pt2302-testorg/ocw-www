course_description: 'This course proposes that investigating the ways in which territory
  is produced, maintained and strategized, generates conflicts, establishes divisions,
  and builds identities can lead to a more critical understanding of architecture''s
  role in society. This course is designed to expand the student''s literacy in the
  concept of territory and its relation to the realm of architecture.
