course_description: 'This course covers basic topics in autonomous marine vehicles,
  focusing mainly on software and algorithms for autonomous decision making (autonomy)
  by underwater vehicles operating in the ocean environments, autonomously adapting
  to the environment for improved sensing performance. It will introduce students
  to underwater acoustic communication environment, as well as the various options
  for undersea navigation, both crucial to the operation of collaborative undersea
  networks for environmental sensing. Sensors for acoustic, biological and chemical
  sensing by underwater vehicles and their integration with the autonomy system for
  environmentally adaptive undersea mapping and observation will be covered. The subject
  will have a significant lab component, involving the use of the MOOS-IvP autonomy
  software infrastructure for developing integrated sensing, modeling and control
  solutions for a variety of ocean observation problems, using simulation environments
  and a field testbed with small autonomous surface craft and underwater vehicles
  operated on the Charles River.
