course_description: 'This course analyzes seminal work directed at the development
  of a computational understanding of human intelligence, such as work on learning,
  language, vision, event representation, commonsense reasoning, self reflection,
  story understanding, and analogy. It reviews visionary ideas of Turing, Minsky,
  and other influential thinkers and examines the implications of work on brain scanning,
  developmental psychology, and cognitive psychology. There is an emphasis on discussion
  and analysis of original papers; students taking the graduate version complete additional
  exercises and a substantial term project.
