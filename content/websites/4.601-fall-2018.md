course_description: 'This course investigates the power of art in historical perspective,
  focusing on Euro-American traditions of art from the fourteenth to the twenty-first
  century. It examines changing conceptions of the artist, the work of art, and the
  discipline of art history, exploring the roles images and objects have played over
  time, how they functioned in various social, economic, and cultural contexts, and
  whose interests they served or sought to disrupt.
