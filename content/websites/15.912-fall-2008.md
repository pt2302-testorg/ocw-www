course_description: 'This course provides a series of strategic frameworks for managing
  high-technology businesses. The emphasis throughout the course is on the development
  and application of conceptual models which clarify the interactions between competition,
  patterns of technological and market change, and the structure and development of
  organizational capabilities.


  This is not a course in how to manage product or process development. The main focus
  is on the acquisition of a set of powerful analytical tools which are critical for
  the development of a technology strategy as an integral part of business strategy.
  These tools can provide the framework for deciding which technologies to invest
  in, how to structure those investments and how to anticipate and respond to the
  behavior of competitors, suppliers, and customers. The course should be of particular
  interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely
  to play a major role, and to those interested in consulting or venture capital.
