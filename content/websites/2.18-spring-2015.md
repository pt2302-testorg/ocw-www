course_description: 'This course focuses on feedback control mechanisms that living
  organisms implement at the molecular level to execute their functions, with emphasis
  on techniques to design novel systems with prescribed behaviors. Students will learn
  how biological functions can be understood and designed using notions from feedback
  control.
