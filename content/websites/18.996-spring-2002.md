course_description: 'We will discuss numerous research problems that are related to
  the internet. Sample topics include: routing algorithms such as BGP, communication
  protocols such as TCP, algorithms for intelligently selecting a resource in the
  face of uncertainty, bandwidth sensing tools, load balancing algorithms, streaming
  protocols, determining the structure of the internet, cost optimization, DNS-related
  problems, visualization, and large-scale data processing. The seminar is intended
  for students who are ready to work on challenging research problems. Each lecture
  will discuss:


  *   methods used today

  *   issues and problems

  *   formulation of concrete problems

  *   potential new lines of research


  A modest amount of background information will be provided so that the importance
  and context of the problems can be understood. No previous study of the internet
  is required, but experience with algorithms and/or theoretical computer science
  at the graduate/research level is needed.
