course_description: "This course will consider the degree and nature of the modular\
  \ organization of the mind and brain. We will focus in detail on the domains of\
  \ objects, number, places, and people,\_drawing on evidence from behavioral studies\
  \ in human infants, children, normal adults, neurological patients, and animals,\
  \ as well as from studies using neural measures such as functional brain imaging\
  \ and ERPs. With these domains as examples, we will address broader questions about\
  \ the role of domain-general and domain-specific processing systems in mature human\
  \ performance, the innateness vs. plasticity of encapsulated cognitive systems,\
  \ the nature of the evidence for such systems, and the processes by which people\
  \ link information flexibly across domains.\n"
