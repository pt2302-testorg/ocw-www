course_description: 'This course provides intensive coverage of the theory and practice
  of electromechanical instrument design with application to biomedical devices. Students
  will work with MGH doctors to develop new medical products from concept to prototype
  development and testing. Lectures will present techniques for designing electronic
  circuits as part of complete sensor systems. Topics covered include: basic electronics
  circuits, principles of accuracy, op amp circuits, analog signal conditioning, power
  supplies, microprocessors, wireless communications, sensors, and sensor interface
  circuits. Labs will cover practical printed circuit board (PCB) design including
  component selection, PCB layout, assembly, and planning and budgeting for large
  projects. Problem sets and labs in the first six weeks are in support of the project.
  Major team-based design, build, and test project in the last six weeks. Student
  teams will be composed of both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering
  students.
