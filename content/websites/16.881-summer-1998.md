course_description: "This course was created for the \"product development\" track\
  \ of MIT's System Design and Management Program (SDM) in conjunction with the Center\
  \ for Innovation in Product Development.\_ After taking this course, a student should\
  \ be able to:\n\n*   Formulate measures of performance of a system or quality characteristics.\
  \ These quality characteristics are to be made robust to noise affecting the system.\n\
  *   Sythesize and select design concepts for robustness.\n*   Identify noise factors\
  \ whose variation may affect the quality characteristics.\n*   Estimate the robustness\
  \ of any given design (experimentally and analytically).\n*   Formulate and implement\
  \ methods to reduce the effects of noise (parameter design, active control, adjustment).\n\
  *   Select rational tolerances for a design.\n*   Explain the role of robust design\
  \ techniques within the wider context of the product development process.\n*   Lead\
  \ product development activities that include robust design techniques.\n"
