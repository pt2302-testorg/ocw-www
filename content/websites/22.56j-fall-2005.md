course_description: '22.56J aims to give graduate students and advanced undergraduates
  background in the theory and application of noninvasive imaging methods to biology
  and medicine, with emphasis on neuroimaging. The course focuses on the modalities
  most frequently used in scientific research (X-ray CT, PET/SPECT, MRI, and optical
  imaging), and includes discussion of molecular imaging approaches used in conjunction
  with these scanning methods. Lectures by the professor will be supplemented by in-class
  discussions of problems in research, and hands-on demonstrations of imaging systems.
