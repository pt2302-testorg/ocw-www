course_description: 'Feedback control is an important technique that is used in many
  modern electronic and electromechanical systems. The successful inclusion of this
  technique improves performance, reliability, and cost effectiveness of many designs.
  In this series of lectures we introduce the analytical concepts that underlie classical
  feedback system design. The application of these concepts is illustrated by a variety
  of experiments and demonstration systems. The diversity of the demonstration systems
  reinforces the value of the analytic methods.
