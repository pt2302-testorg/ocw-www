course_description: 'The course aims at providing a fundamental understanding of the
  physics related to buildings and to propose an overview of the various issues that
  have to be adequately combined to offer the occupants a physical, functional and
  psychological well-being. Students will be guided through the different components,
  constraints and systems of a work of architecture. These will be examined both independently
  and in the manner in which they interact and affect one another.
