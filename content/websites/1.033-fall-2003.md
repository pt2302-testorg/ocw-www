course_description: '1.033 provides an introduction to continuum mechanics and material
  modeling of engineering materials based on first energy principles: deformation
  and strain; momentum balance, stress and stress states; elasticity and elasticity
  bounds; plasticity and yield design. The overarching theme is a unified mechanistic
  language using thermodynamics, which allows understanding, modeling and design of
  a large range of engineering materials. This course is offered both to undergraduate
  (1.033) and graduate (1.57) students.
