course_description: "The theory of special relativity, originally proposed by Albert\
  \ Einstein in his famous 1905 paper, has had profound consequences on our view of\
  \ physics, space, and time. This course will introduce you to the concepts behind\
  \ special relativity including, but not limited to, length contraction, time dilation,\
  \ the Lorentz transformation, relativistic kinematics, Doppler shifts, and even\
  \ so-called \u201Cparadoxes.\u201D\n"
