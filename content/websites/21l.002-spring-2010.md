course_description: 'This course comprises a broad survey of texts, literary and philosophical,
  which trace the development of the modern world from the seventeenth to the early
  twentieth century. Intrinsic to this development is the growth of individualism
  in a world no longer understood to be at the center of the universe. The texts chosen
  for study exemplify the emergence of a new humanism, at once troubled and dynamic
  in comparison to the old. The leading theme of this course is thus the question
  of the difference between the ancient and the modern world. Students who have taken
  Foundations of Western Culture I will obviously have an advantage in dealing with
  this question. Classroom discussion approaches this question mainly through consideration
  of action and characters, voice and form.
