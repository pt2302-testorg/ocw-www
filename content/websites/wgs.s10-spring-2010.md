course_description: 'This course will explore the rich diversity of women''s voices
  and experiences as reflected in writings and films by and about Latina writers,
  filmmakers, and artists. Through close readings, class discussions and independently
  researched student presentations related to each text, we will explore not only
  the unique, individual voice of the writer, but also the cultural, social and political
  contexts which inform their narratives. We will also examine the roles that gender,
  familial ties and social and political preoccupations play in shaping the values
  of the writers and the nature of the characters encountered in the texts and films.
