course_description: 'This core class in the Environmental M.Eng. program is for all
  students interested in the behavior of chemicals in the environment. The emphasis
  is on man-made chemicals; their movement through water, air, and soil; and their
  eventual fate. Physical transport, as well as chemical and biological sources and
  sinks, are discussed. Linkages to health effects, sources and control, and policy
  aspects are discussed and debated.
