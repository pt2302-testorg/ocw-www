course_description: "\"What then is the American, this new man?\" asked J. Hector\
  \ St-John de Cr\xE8vecoeur in his _Letters from an American Farmer_ in 1782. This\
  \ subject takes Cr\xE8vecoeur's question as the starting point for an examination\
  \ of the changing meanings of national identity in the American past. We will consider\
  \ a diverse collection of classic texts in American history to see how Americans\
  \ have defined themselves and their nation in politics, literature, art, and popular\
  \ culture. As a communications-intensive subject, students will be expected to engage\
  \ intensively with the material through frequent oral and written exercises.\n"
