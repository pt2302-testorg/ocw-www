course_description: "In this course you will learn the basics of photography and gain\
  \ an intriguing new perspective into the visual world. We will begin with a gentle\
  \ introduction to the tools, and after that, we start in earnest.\n\nAlthough we\
  \ will emphasize photographing science and engineering, most of the material will\
  \ easily apply to other kinds of macro photography. The course's video tutorials\
  \ will be accompanied by assignments using a camera, a flatbed scanner, and mobile\
  \ devices. You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background\
  \ contribute to creating more effective images. You will also learn to think graphically\
  \ and present your photographs for journal figures, covers, and grant submissions.\
  \ We will also host interviews with notable image makers and art directors.\_\n\n\
