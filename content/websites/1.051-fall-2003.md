course_description: 'This course aims at providing students with a solid background
  on the principles of structural engineering design. Students will be exposed to
  the theories and concepts of both concrete and steel design and analysis both at
  the element and system levels. Hands-on design experience and skills will be gained
  and learned through problem sets and a comprehensive design project. An understanding
  of real-world open-ended design issues will be developed. Besides regular lectures,
  weekly recitations and project discussion sessions will be held.
