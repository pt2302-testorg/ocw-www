course_description: 'This course explores the issue of human trafficking for forced
  labour and sexual slavery, focusing on its representation in recent scholarly accounts
  and advocacy as well as in other media. Ethnographic and fictional readings along
  with media analysis help to develop a contextualized and comparative understanding
  of the phenomena in both past and present contexts. It examines the wide range of
  factors and agents that enable these practices, such as technology, cultural practices,
  social and economic conditions, and the role of governments and international organizations.
  The course also discusses the analytical, moral and methodological questions of
  researching, writing, and representing trafficking and slavery.
