course_description: 'This subject examines the historical development and contemporary
  politics of social policy in the United States. We will discuss the kinds of risks
  individuals face over a lifetime and why some are ameliorated by social policy while
  others are not (and how the U.S. is similar or different from other countries in
  this regard). We will examine the policymaking process in the U.S., why some alternatives
  are implemented and others abandoned, why some interests are privileged over others,
  and how the designs of policies can feed back and shape politics in a given policy
  area. Along the way we will examine interactions among political institutions, policy
  elites, the media, and the mass public.
