course_description: 'This course will survey the conditions of material life and changing
  social and economic conditions in medieval Europe with reference to the comparative
  context of contemporary Islamic, Chinese, and central Asian experiences. Subject
  covers the emergence and decline of feudal institutions, the transformation of peasant
  agriculture, living standards and the course of epidemic disease, and the ebb and
  flow of long-distance trade across the Eurasian system. Particular emphasis will
  be placed on the study of those factors, both institutional and technological, which
  have contributed to the emergence of capitalist organization and economic growth
  in Western Europe in contrast to the trajectories followed by the other major medieval
  economies.
