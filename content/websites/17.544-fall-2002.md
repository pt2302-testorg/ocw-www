course_description: 'This graduate seminar has two main goals: to explore the main
  theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of contemporary Chinese politics;
  and to relate those approches to broader trends in the field of comparative politics.
  What has the study of China contributed to the field of comparative politics, and
  vice versa? What are the most effective ways to integrate area studies, broader
  comparative approaches, and theory? Seminar presumes a basic understanding of the
  history and politics of contemporary China.
