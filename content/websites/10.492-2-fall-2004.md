course_description: 'This course provides a brief introduction to the field of biocatalysis
  in the context of process design. Fundamental topics include why and when one may
  choose to use biological systems for chemical conversion, considerations for using
  free enzymes versus whole cells, and issues related to design and development of
  bioconversion processes. Biological and engineering problems are discussed as well
  as how one may arrive at both biological and engineering solutions.
