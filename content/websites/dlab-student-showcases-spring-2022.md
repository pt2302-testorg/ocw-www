course_description: "Student projects in [D-Lab classes](https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes)\
  \ are defined by community partners and social ventures around the world. We don't\
  \ always know what is needed, but our community partners do, and our students have\
  \ technical knowledge and skills to contribute to that work.\n\nEach semester, through\
  \ a selection of full-semester classes, our students form into teams to work on\
  \ projects framed by community partners\_\u2013 NGOs, local nonprofits, and social\
  \ entrepreneurs. At the end of each semester, students present their work to their\
  \ peers, partners, and guests."
