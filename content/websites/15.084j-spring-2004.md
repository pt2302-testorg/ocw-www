course_description: 'This course introduces students to the fundamentals of nonlinear
  optimization theory and methods. Topics include unconstrained and constrained optimization,
  linear and quadratic programming, Lagrange and conic duality theory, interior-point
  algorithms and theory, Lagrangian relaxation, generalized programming, and semi-definite
  programming. Algorithmic methods used in the class include steepest descent, Newton''s
  method, conditional gradient and subgradient optimization, interior-point methods
  and penalty and barrier methods.
