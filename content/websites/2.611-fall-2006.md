course_description: 'This course discusses the selection and evaluation of commercial
  and naval ship power and propulsion systems. It will cover the analysis of propulsors,
  prime mover thermodynamic cycles, propeller-engine matching, propeller selection,
  waterjet analysis, and reviews alternative propulsors. The course also investigates
  thermodynamic analyses of Rankine, Brayton, Diesel, and Combined cycles, reduction
  gears and integrated electric drive. Battery operated vehicles and fuel cells are
  also discussed. The term project requires analysis of alternatives in propulsion
  plant design for given physical, performance, and economic constraints. Graduate
  students complete different assignments and exams.
