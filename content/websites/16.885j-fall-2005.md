course_description: '16.885J offers a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering:
  basic systems engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance;
  safety and reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and
  management; and system realization. Small student teams retrospectively analyze
  an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions; aircraft attributes
  and subsystems; and operational experience. Oral and written versions of the case
  study are delivered. For the Fall 2005 term, the class focuses on a systems engineering
  analysis of the Space Shuttle. It offers study of both design and operations of
  the shuttle, with frequent lectures by outside experts. Students choose specific
  shuttle systems for detailed analysis and develop new subsystem designs using state
  of the art technology.
