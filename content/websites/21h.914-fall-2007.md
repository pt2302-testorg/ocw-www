course_description: 'This course explores how our views of Jewish history have been
  formed and how this history can explain the survival of the Jews as an ethnic/religious
  group into the present day. Special attention is given to the partial and fragmentary
  nature of our information about the past, and the difficulties inherent in decoding
  statements about the past that were written with a religious agenda in mind. It
  also considers complex events in Jewish history -- from early history as portrayed
  in the Bible to recent history, including the Holocaust.
