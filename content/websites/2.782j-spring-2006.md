course_description: 'This design course targets the solution of clinical problems
  by use of implants and other medical devices. Topics include the systematic use
  of cell-matrix control volumes; the role of stress analysis in the design process;
  anatomic fit, shape and size of implants; selection of biomaterials; instrumentation
  for surgical implantation procedures; preclinical testing for safety and efficacy,
  including risk/benefit ratio assessment evaluation of clinical performance and design
  of clinical trials. Student project materials are drawn from orthopedic devices,
  soft tissue implants, artificial organs, and dental implants.
