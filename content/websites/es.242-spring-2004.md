course_description: 'Does it matter in education whether or not you''ve got a Y chromosome?
  You bet it does. In this discussion-based seminar, we will explore why males vastly
  outrank females in math and science and career advancements (particularly in academia),
  and why girls get better grades and go to college more often than boys. Do the sexes
  have different learning styles? Are women denied advanced opportunities in academia
  and the workforce? How do family life and family decisions affect careers for both
  men and women?
