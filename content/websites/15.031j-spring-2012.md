course_description: 'This course examines the choices and constraints regarding sources
  and uses of energy by households, firms, and governments through a number of frameworks
  to describe and explain behavior at various levels of aggregation. Examples include
  a wide range of countries, scope, settings, and analytical approaches.


  This course is one of many [OCW Energy Courses](/courses/energy-courses/), and it
  is a core subject in MIT''s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/).
  This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major
  with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and
  social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.
