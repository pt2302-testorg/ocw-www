course_description: 'This course reviews momentum and energy principles, and then
  covers the following topics: Hamilton''s principle and Lagrange''s equations; three-dimensional
  kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies; steady motions and small deviations therefrom,
  gyroscopic effects, and causes of instability; free and forced vibrations of lumped-parameter
  and continuous systems; nonlinear oscillations and the phase plane; nonholonomic
  systems; and an introduction to wave propagation in continuous systems.


  This course was originally developed by Professor T. Akylas.
