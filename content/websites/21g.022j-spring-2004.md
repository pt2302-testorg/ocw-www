course_description: "International Women\u2019s Voices has several objectives. It\
  \ introduces students to a variety of works by contemporary women writers from Asia,\
  \ Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and North America. The emphasis is on non-western\
  \ writers. The readings are chosen to encourage students to think about how each\
  \ author\u2019s work reflects a distinct cultural heritage and to what extent, if\
  \ any, we can identify a female voice that transcends national cultures. In lectures\
  \ and readings distributed in class, students learn about the history and culture\
  \ of each of the countries these authors represent. The way in which colonialism,\
  \ religion, nation formation and language influence each writer is a major concern\
  \ of this course. In addition, students examine the patterns of socialization of\
  \ women in patriarchal cultures, and how, in the imaginary world, authors resolve\
  \ or understand the relationship of the characters to love, work, identity, sex\
  \ roles, marriage, and politics.\n"
