course_description: 'The course covers the basic techniques for evaluating the maximum
  forces and loads over the life of a marine structure or vehicle, so as to be able
  to design its basic configuration. Loads and motions of small and large structures
  and their short-term and long-term statistics are studied in detail and many applications
  are presented in class and studied in homework and laboratory sessions. Issues related
  to seakeeping of ships are studied in detail. The basic equations and issues of
  maneuvering are introduced at the end of the course. Three laboratory sessions demonstrate
  the phenomena studied and provide experience with experimental methods and data
  processing.


  This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Ocean Engineering) as 13.42.
