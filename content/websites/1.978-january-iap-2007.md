course_description: 'The objective of this course is to introduce large-scale atomistic
  modeling techniques and highlight its importance for solving problems in modern
  engineering sciences. We demonstrate how atomistic modeling can be used to understand
  how materials fail under extreme loading, involving unfolding of proteins and propagation
  of cracks.
