course_description: 'This graduate-level course focuses on mass political behavior
  within the American political system. The goal of this course is to give an introduction
  to some of the major questions in the study of American political behavior, and
  how people have gone about answering them. The background goal is to help students
  practice reading work critically, and thinking through the difficulties of social
  science research, in preparation for individual research projects. The course examines
  political ideology, public opinion, voting behavior, media effects, racial attitudes,
  mass-elite relations, and opinion-policy linkages.
