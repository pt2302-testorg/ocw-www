course_description: 'Through site-specific client-based work, this course will allow
  students to materially contribute to redevelopment decision-making regarding a former
  inner-city industrial site. The course will focus on generating and analyzing pragmatic
  redevelopment scenarios given the issues of brownfields and environmental contamination,
  community preferences, regulatory constraints and economic realities.


  The course is designed along two parallel and mutually reinforcing educational tracks:
  Field learning and classroom reflection, with ample time built into the schedule
  for both. As the course will focus on an actual site, there will be a sizeable portion
  of student time spent on location and in the surrounding community.
