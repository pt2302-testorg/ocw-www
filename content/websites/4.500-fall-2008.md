course_description: 'This course will introduce students to architectural design and
  computation through the use of computer modeling, rendering and digital fabrication.
  The course focuses on teaching architectural design with CAD drawing, 3-D modeling,
  rendering and rapid prototyping. Students will be required to build computer models
  that will lead to a full package of architectural explorations with computers. Each
  semester we will explore the design process of a particular building type and building
  material.


  The course also investigates a few design processes of selected architects. The
  course is critical of design principles and building production methods. Student
  assignments are graded based on the quality of design, representation and constructability.
  Great design input is always encouraged.
