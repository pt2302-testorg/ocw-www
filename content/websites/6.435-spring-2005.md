course_description: 'This course is offered to graduates and includes topics such
  as mathematical models of systems from observations of their behavior; time series,
  state-space, and input-output models; model structures, parametrization, and identifiability;
  non-parametric methods; prediction error methods for parameter estimation, convergence,
  consistency, and asymptotic distribution; relations to maximum likelihood estimation;
  recursive estimation; relation to Kalman filters; structure determination; order
  estimation; Akaike criterion; bounded but unknown noise model; and robustness and
  practical issues.
