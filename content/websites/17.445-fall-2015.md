course_description: 'This course examines cyber dynamics and processes in international
  relations from different theoretical perspectives. It considers alternative theoretical
  and empirical frameworks consistent with characteristic features of cyberspace and
  emergent transformations at all levels of international interaction. Theories examined
  include realism and neorealism, institutionalism and liberalism, constructivism,
  and systems theory and lateral pressure. The course also highlights relevant features
  and proposes customized international relations theory for the cyber age.


  Students taking the graduate version are expected to pursue the subject in greater
  depth through reading and individual research.
