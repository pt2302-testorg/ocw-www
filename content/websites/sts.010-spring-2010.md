course_description: 'This course explores the social relevance of neuroscience, considering
  how emerging areas of brain research at once reflect and reshape social attitudes
  and agendas. Topics include brain imaging and popular media; neuroscience of empathy,
  trust, and moral reasoning; new fields of neuroeconomics and neuromarketing; ethical
  implications of neurotechnologies such as cognitive enhancement pharmaceuticals;
  neuroscience in the courtroom; and neuroscientific recasting of social problems
  such as addiction and violence. Guest lectures by neuroscientists, class discussion,
  and weekly readings in neuroscience, popular media, and science studies.
