  development practitioners to address capital needs for businesses and economic development
  projects. It provides an overview of private capital markets and financing sources
  to understand capital market imperfections that constrain economic development,
  business accounting, financial statement analysis, federal economic development
  programs, and public finance tools. The course covers policies and program models,
  including revolving loan funds, guarantee programs, venture capital funds, bank
  holding companies, community development loan funds and credit unions, micro-enterprise
  funds, and the Community Reinvestment Act. The objective of this course is to provide
  students with a comprehensive overview of economic development finance practice
  in the United States, and to develop a knowledge base and skills to either be a
  development finance practitioner, or apply economic development finance approaches
  to other fields of planning and community development.
