course_description: "Studies synthesis of polymeric materials, emphasizing interrelationships\
  \ of chemical pathways, process conditions, and microarchitecture of molecules produced.\
  \ Chemical pathways include traditional approaches such as anionic polymerization,\
  \ radical condensation, and ring-opening polymerizations. Other techniques are discussed,\
  \ including stable free radical polymerizations and atom transfer free radical polymerizations\
  \ (ARTP), catalytic approaches to well-defined architectures, and polymer functionalization\
  \ in bulk and at surfaces. Process conditions include bulk, solution, emulsion,\
  \ suspension, gas phase, and batch vs. continuous fluidized bed. Microarchitecture\
  \ includes tacticity, molecular-weight distribution, sequence distributions in copolymers,\
  \ errors in chains such as branches, head-to-head addition, and peroxide incorporation.\n\
  \n##### Acknowledgements\n\nThe instructor would like to thank Karen Shu and Karen\
  \ Daniel for their work in preparing\_material for this course site.\n"
