course_description: 'This is a project to assist in the design, drawing, modeling
  and hopefully constructing of a small Community Children''s Center near Guayaquil,
  Ecuador. For the last year, Nicki Lehrer, from MIT''s Aero/Astro Department, has
  been organizing efforts to build the project. The goal of the workshop is to provide
  her with a full fleshed out design for the community center so it can be built in
  the summer of 2007.
