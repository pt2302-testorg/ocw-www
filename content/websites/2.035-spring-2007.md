course_description: 'This course forms an introduction to a selection of mathematical
  topics that are not covered in traditional mechanical engineering curricula, such
  as differential geometry, integral geometry, discrete computational geometry, graph
  theory, optimization techniques, calculus of variations and linear algebra. The
  topics covered in any particular year depend on the interest of the students and
  instructor. Emphasis is on basic ideas and on applications in mechanical engineering.
  This year, the subject focuses on selected topics from linear algebra and the calculus
  of variations. It is aimed mainly (but not exclusively) at students aiming to study
  mechanics (solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, energy methods etc.), and the course
  introduces some of the mathematical tools used in these subjects. Applications are
  related primarily (but not exclusively) to the microstructures of crystalline solids.
