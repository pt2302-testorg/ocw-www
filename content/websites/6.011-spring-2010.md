course_description: 'This course examines signals, systems and inference as unifying
  themes in communication, control and signal processing. Topics include input-output
  and state-space models of linear systems driven by deterministic and random signals;
  time- and transform-domain representations in discrete and continuous time; group
  delay; state feedback and observers; probabilistic models; stochastic processes,
  correlation functions, power spectra, spectral factorization; least-mean square
  error estimation; Wiener filtering; hypothesis testing; detection; matched filters.
