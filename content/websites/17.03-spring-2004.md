course_description: 'This course examines major texts in the history of political
  thought and the questions they raise about the design of the political and social
  order. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular
  political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader
  conversation about human goods and needs, justice, democracy, and the proper relationship
  of the individual to the state. One aim will be to understand the strengths and
  weaknesses of various regimes and philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical
  perspective on our own. Thinkers include Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes,
  Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville.
