course_description: 'This course is the third and last term of the quantum field theory
  sequence. Its aim is the proper theoretical discussion of the physics of the standard
  model. Topics include: quantum chromodynamics; the Higgs phenomenon and a description
  of the standard model; deep-inelastic scattering and structure functions; basics
  of lattice gauge theory; operator products and effective theories; detailed structure
  of the standard model; spontaneously broken gauge theory and its quantization; instantons
  and theta-vacua; topological defects; introduction to supersymmetry.
