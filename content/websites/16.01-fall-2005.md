course_description: 'The basic objective of Unified Engineering is to give a solid
  understanding of the fundamental disciplines of aerospace engineering, as well as
  their interrelationships and applications. These disciplines are Materials and Structures
  (M); Computers and Programming (C); Fluid Mechanics (F); Thermodynamics (T); Propulsion
  (P); and Signals and Systems (S). In choosing to teach these subjects in a unified
  manner, the instructors seek to explain the common intellectual threads in these
  disciplines, as well as their combined application to solve engineering Systems
  Problems (SP). Throughout the year, the instructors emphasize the connections among
  the disciplines.
