  Topics include measure theoretic probability, martingales, filtration, and stopping
  theorems, elements of large deviations theory, Brownian motion and reflected Brownian
  motion, stochastic integration and Ito calculus and functional limit theorems. In
  addition, the class will go over some applications to finance theory, insurance,
  queueing and inventory models.
