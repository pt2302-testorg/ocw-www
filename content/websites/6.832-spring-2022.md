course_description: 'Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems
  that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals
  move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss
  of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete
  control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural
  dynamics of our machines.


  This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical
  systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear
  dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion
  planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion,
  compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.'
