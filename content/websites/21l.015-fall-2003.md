course_description: 'Introduction to Media Studies is designed for students who have
  grown up in a rapidly changing global multimedia environment and want to become
  more literate and critical consumers and producers of culture. Through an interdisciplinary
  comparative and historical lens, the course defines "media" broadly as including
  oral, print, theatrical, photographic, broadcast, cinematic, and digital cultural
  forms and practices. The course looks at the nature of mediated communication, the
  functions of media, the history of transformations in media and the institutions
  that help define media''s place in society.


  Over the course of the semester we explore different theoretical perspectives on
  the role and power of media in society in influencing our social values, political
  beliefs, identities and behaviors. Students also have the opportunity to analyze
  specific media texts (such as films and television shows) and explore the meaning
  of the changes that occur when a particular narrative is adapted into different
  media forms. We look at the ways in which the politics of class, gender and race
  influence both the production and reception of media. To represent different perspectives
  on media, several guest speakers also present lectures. Through the readings, lectures,
  and discussions as well as their own writing and oral presentations, students have
  multiple opportunities to engage with critical debates in the field as well as explore
  the role of media in their own lives.
