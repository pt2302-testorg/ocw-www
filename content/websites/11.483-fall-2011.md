course_description: 'A truly inter-disciplinary course, Housing and Land Use in Rapidly
  Urbanizing Regions reviews how law, economics, sociology, political science, and
  planning conceptualize urban land and property rights and uses cases to discuss
  what these different lenses illuminate and obscure. It also looks at how the social
  sciences might be informed by how design, cartography, and visual studies conceptualize
  space''s physicality. This year''s topics include land trusts for affordable housing,
  mixed-use in public space, and critical cartography.
