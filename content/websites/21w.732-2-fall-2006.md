course_description: 'This section of Introduction to Technical Communication deals
  with ethical issues associated with the design, use, and propagation of technology.
  At virtually all stages of development and use, any technology can carry with it
  ethical dilemmas for both creators and users. Of particular interest is how such
  dilemmas are resolved (or complicated) according to how effectively they are communicated
  to stakeholders.
