course_description: "This course offers an introduction to Women's and Gender Studies,\
  \ an interdisciplinary field that asks critical questions about the meanings of\
  \ sex and gender in society. The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students\
  \ with key issues, questions and debates in Women's and Gender Studies, both historical\
  \ and contemporary.\_Gender studies scholarship critically analyzes themes of gendered\
  \ performance and power in a range of social spheres, such as education, law, culture,\
  \ work, medicine and the family. \_WGS. 101 draws on multiple disciplines--such\
  \ as literature, history, economics, psychology, sociology, philosophy, political\
  \ science, anthropology and media studies-- to examine cultural assumptions about\
  \ sex, gender, and sexuality. This course integrates analysis of current events\
  \ through student presentations, aiming to increase awareness of contemporary and\
  \ historical experiences of women, and of the multiple ways that sex and gender\
  \ interact with race, class, nationality and other social identities.\n"
