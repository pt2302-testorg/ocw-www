course_description: 'This course introduces students to basic properties of structural
  materials and behavior of simple structural elements and systems through a series
  of experiments. Students learn experimental technique, data collection, reduction
  and analysis, and presentation of results. Students generally take this subject
  during the same semester as [1.050](courses/1-050-solid-mechanics-fall-2004), Solid
  Mechanics.
