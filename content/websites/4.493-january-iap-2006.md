course_description: 'Today, computer-based simulations are becoming increasingly popular,
  especially when daylighting and energy conservation are amongst the key goals for
  a project. This two-week workshop will expose participants to the current daylighting
  simulation models and beyond, by introducing realistic and dynamic assessment methods
  through hands-on exercises and application to a design project. Open to students
  and practitioners.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
