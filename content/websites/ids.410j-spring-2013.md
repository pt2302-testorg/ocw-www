course_description: '_IDS.410J Modeling and Assessment for Policy_ explores how scientific
  information and quantitative models can be used to inform policy decision-making.
  Students will develop an understanding of quantitative modeling techniques and their
  role in the policy process through case studies and interactive activities. The
  course addresses issues such as analysis of scientific assessment processes, uses
  of integrated assessment models, public perception of quantitative information,
  methods for dealing with uncertainties, and design choices in building policy-relevant
  models. Examples used in this class focus on models and information used in earth
  system governance.
