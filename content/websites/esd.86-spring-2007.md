course_description: 'In this class, students use data and systems knowledge to build
  models of complex socio-technical systems for improved system design and decision-making.
  Students will enhance their model-building skills, through review and extension
  of functions of random variables, Poisson processes, and Markov processes; move
  from applied probability to statistics via Chi-squared t and f tests, derived as
  functions of random variables; and review classical statistics, hypothesis tests,
  regression, correlation and causation, simple data mining techniques, and Bayesian
  vs. classical statistics. A class project is required.
