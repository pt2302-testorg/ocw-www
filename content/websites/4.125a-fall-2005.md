course_description: 'This subject introduces skills needed to build within a landscape
  establishing continuities between the built and natural world. Students learn to
  build appropriately through analysis of landscape and climate for a chosen site,
  and to conceptualize design decisions through drawings and models.


  This class was taught concurrently with [4.125B](/courses/4-125b-architecture-studio-building-in-landscapes-fall-2005/).
  Some of the assignments are the same, some are different, and the sites for the
  final project are different. But since they were taught in tandem, it would be useful
  to look at both together.'
