course_description: 'Discrete stochastic processes are essentially probabilistic systems
  that evolve in time via random changes occurring at discrete fixed or random intervals.
  This course aims to help students acquire both the mathematical principles and the
  intuition necessary to create, analyze, and understand insightful models for a broad
  range of these processes. The range of areas for which discrete stochastic-process
  models are useful is constantly expanding, and includes many applications in engineering,
  physics, biology, operations research and finance.
