course_description: 'This course is a historical exploration of the ways that people
  have interacted with their closest animal relatives, for example: hunting, domestication
  of livestock, exploitation of animal labor, scientific study of animals, display
  of exotic and performing animals, and pet-keeping. Themes include changing ideas
  about animal agency and intelligence, our moral obligations to animals, and the
  limits imposed on the use of animals. Students taking the graduate version complete
  additional assignments.
