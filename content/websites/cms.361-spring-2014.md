course_description: 'This seminar is a space for collaborative inquiry into the relationships
  between social movements and the media. We''ll review these relationships through
  the lens of social movement theory, and function as a workshop to develop student
  projects. Seminar participants will work together to explore frameworks, methods,
  and tools for understanding networked social movements in the digital media ecology.
  We will engage with social movement studies as a body of theoretical and empirical
  work, and learn about key concepts including: resource mobilization; political process;
  framing; New Social Movements; collective identity; tactical media; protest cycles;
  movement structure; and more. We''ll explore methods of social movement investigation,
  examine new data sources and tools for movement analysis, and grapple with recent
  innovations in social movement theory and research. Assignments include short blog
  posts, a book review, co-facilitation of a seminar discussion, and a final research
  project focused on social movement media practices in comparative perspective.
