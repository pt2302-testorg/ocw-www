course_description: 'This course will conduct a comparative study of the grand strategies
  of the great powers (Britain, France, Germany and Russia) competing for mastery
  of Europe from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. Grand strategy
  is the collection of political and military means and ends with which a state attempts
  to achieve security. We will examine strategic developments in the years preceding
  World Wars I and II, and how those developments played themselves out in these wars.
  The following questions will guide the inquiry: What is grand strategy and what
  are its critical aspects? What recurring factors have exerted the greatest influence
  on the strategies of the states selected for study? How may the quality of a grand
  strategy be judged? What consequences seem to follow from grand strategies of different
  types? A second theme of the course is methodological. We will pay close attention
  to how comparative historical case studies are conducted.
