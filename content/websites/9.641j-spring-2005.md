course_description: 'This course explores the organization of synaptic connectivity
  as the basis of neural computation and learning. Perceptrons and dynamical theories
  of recurrent networks including amplifiers, attractors, and hybrid computation are
  covered. Additional topics include backpropagation and Hebbian learning, as well
  as models of perception, motor control, memory, and neural development.
