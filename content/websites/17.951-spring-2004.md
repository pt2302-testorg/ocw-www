course_description: "This course provides an introduction to the vast literature devoted\
  \ to public opinion. In the next 12 weeks, we will survey the major theoretical\
  \ approaches and empirical research\_in the field of political behavior (though\
  \ we will only tangentially discuss political\_ participation and voting). For the\
  \ most part we will focus on American public opinion, though some of the work we\
  \ will read is comparative in nature.\n"
