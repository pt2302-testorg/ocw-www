course_description: 'How do we decide whether an action is morally wrong? How do we
  choose to do what is right? When and why do we punish wrong-doers? Moral behavior
  and moral evaluation are functions of the human brain. It is just becoming possible
  to use neuroscientific methods to understand how they work. This course will consider
  the mechanisms of morality as a question for neuroscientists.
