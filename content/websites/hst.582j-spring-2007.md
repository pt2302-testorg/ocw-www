course_description: "This course presents the fundamentals of digital signal processing\
  \ with particular emphasis on problems in biomedical research and clinical medicine.\
  \ It covers principles and algorithms for processing both deterministic and random\
  \ signals. Topics include data acquisition, imaging, filtering, coding, feature\
  \ extraction, and modeling. The focus of the course is a series of labs that provide\
  \ practical experience in processing physiological data, with examples from cardiology,\
  \ speech processing, and medical imaging. The labs are done in MATLAB\xAE during\
  \ weekly lab sessions that take place in an electronic classroom. Lectures cover\
  \ signal processing topics relevant to the lab exercises, as well as background\
  \ on the biological signals processed in the labs.\n"
