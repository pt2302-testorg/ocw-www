course_description: "This course focuses on introducing the language, libraries, tools\
  \ and concepts of Java\u1D40\u1D39. The course is specifically targeted at students\
  \ who intend to take [6.170](courses/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005)\
  \ in the following term and feel they would struggle because they lack the necessary\
  \ background. Topics include: Object-oriented programming, primitives, arrays, objects,\
  \ inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, hashing, data structures, collections,\
  \ nested classes, floating point precision, defensive programming, and depth-first\
  \ search algorithm."
