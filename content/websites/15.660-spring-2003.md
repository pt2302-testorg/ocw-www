  management strategies. This course has two central themes: (1) How to think systematically
  and strategically about aspects of managing the organization''s human assets, and
  (2) What really needs to be done to implement these policies and to achieve competitive
  advantage. It adopts the perspective of a general manager and addresses human resource
  topics (including reward systems, performance management, high-performance human
  resource systems, training and development, recruitment, retention, equal employment
  opportunity laws, work-force diversity, and union-management relationships) from
  a strategic perspective.
