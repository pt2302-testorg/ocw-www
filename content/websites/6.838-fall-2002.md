course_description: 'Animation is a compelling and effective form of expression; it
  engages viewers and makes difficult concepts easier to grasp. Today''s animation
  industry creates films, special effects, and games with stunning visual detail and
  quality. This graduate class will investigate the algorithms that make these animations
  possible: keyframing, inverse kinematics, physical simulation, optimization, optimal
  control, motion capture, and data-driven methods. Our study will also reveal the
  shortcomings of these sophisticated tools. The students will propose improvements
  and explore new methods for computer animation in semester-long research projects.
  The course should appeal to both students with general interest in computer graphics
  and students interested in new applications of machine learning, robotics, biomechanics,
  physics, applied mathematics and scientific computing.
