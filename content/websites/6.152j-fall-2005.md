course_description: 'This course introduces the theory and technology of micro/nano
  fabrication. Lectures and laboratory sessions focus on basic processing techniques
  such as diffusion, oxidation, photolithography, chemical vapor deposition, and more.
  Through team lab assignments, students are expected to gain an understanding of
  these processing techniques, and how they are applied in concert to device fabrication.
  Students enrolled in this course have a unique opportunity to fashion and test micro/nano-devices,
  using modern techniques and technology.
