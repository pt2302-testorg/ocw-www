course_description: 'This course explores how identities, whether of individuals or
  groups, are produced, maintained, and transformed. Students will be introduced to
  various theoretical perspectives that deal with identity formation, including constructions
  of "the normal." We will explore the utility of these perspectives for understanding
  identity components such as gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion,
  language, social class, and bodily difference. By semester''s end students will
  understand better how an individual can be at once cause and consequence of society,
  a unique agent of social action as well as a social product.
