course_description: 'Twentieth and twenty-first century architecture is defined by
  its rhetorical subservience to something called "technology." Architecture relates
  to technology in multiple forms, as the organizational basis of society, as production
  system, as formal inspiration, as mode of temporization, as communicational vehicle,
  and so on. Managerial or "systems-based" paradigms for societal, industrial and
  governmental organization have routinely percolated into architecture''s considerations,
  at its various scales from the urban to the domestic, of the relationships of parts
  to wholes.
