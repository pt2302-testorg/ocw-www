course_description: "This course applies the tools of anthropology to examine biology\
  \ in the age of genomics, biotechnological enterprise, biodiversity conservation,\
  \ pharmaceutical bioprospecting, and synthetic biology. It examines such social\
  \ concerns such as bioterrorism, genetic modification, and cloning. It offers an\
  \ anthropological inquiry into how the substances and explanations of biology \u2014\
  \ ecological, organismic, cellular, molecular, genetic, informatic \u2014 are changing.\
  \ The course also examines such artifacts as cell lines, biodiversity databases,\
  \ and artificial life models, and using primary sources in biology, social studies\
  \ of the life sciences, and literary and cinematic materials, asks how we might\
  \ answer Erwin Schr\xF6dinger's 1944 question, \"What Is Life?\", today."
