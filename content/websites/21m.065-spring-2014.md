course_description: 'Through a progressive series of composition projects, students
  investigate the sonic organization of musical works and performances, focusing on
  fundamental questions of unity and variety. Aesthetic issues are considered in the
  pragmatic context of the instructions that composers provide to achieve a desired
  musical result, whether these instructions are notated in prose, as graphic images,
  or in symbolic notation. No formal training is required. Weekly listening, reading,
  and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual
  traditions, from various cultures and historical periods.
