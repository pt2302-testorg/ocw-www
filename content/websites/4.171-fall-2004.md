course_description: 'This workshop explores how designers might become as sensitive
  to space as they are to objects. Through a number of projects and precedent studies,
  architectural design is studied in relation to the Space Between. The design process
  is studied in reverse, considering space first and objects second. This is not to
  imply that objects are not important, but rather that space is equally important.
