course_description: "We begin by considering briefly the evolution of the family,\
  \ its cross-cultural variability, and its history in the West. We next examine how\
  \ the family is currently defined in the U.S., discussing different views about\
  \ what families should look like.\_Class and ethnic variability and the effects\
  \ of changing gender roles are discussed in this section. We next look at sexuality,\
  \ traditional and non-traditional marriage, parenting, divorce, family violence,\
  \ family economics, poverty, and family policy.\_Controversial issues dealt with\
  \ include day care, welfare policy, and the \"Family Values\" debate.\n"
