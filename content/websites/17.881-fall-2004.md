course_description: 'Increasingly, political scientists are using game theory to analyze
  strategic interactions across many different settings. Each of the sub-fields, to
  differing degrees, has seen game theoretic concepts enter its vocabulary, and students
  entering the profession will need to understand the potential and limits of game
  theory. This course aims to give students an entry-level understanding of the basic
  concepts of game theory, and how these concepts have been applied to the study of
  political phenomena.


  Because an important component of game theory in political science and political
  economy is the analysis of substantive political phenomena, we will cover illustrative
  examples each week in combination with methodological developments. The political
  and economic phenomena that we will examine include legislative rules, nuclear deterrence,
  electoral competition, and imperfect markets.
