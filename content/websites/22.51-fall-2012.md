course_description: 'This subject introduces the key concepts and formalism of quantum
  mechanics and their relevance to topics in current research and to practical applications.
  Starting from the foundation of quantum mechanics and its applications in simple
  discrete systems, it develops the basic principles of interaction of electromagnetic
  radiation with matter.


  Topics covered are composite systems and entanglement, open system dynamics and
  decoherence, quantum theory of radiation, time-dependent perturbation theory, scattering
  and cross sections. Examples are drawn from active research topics and applications,
  such as quantum information processing, coherent control of radiation-matter interactions,
  neutron interferometry and magnetic resonance.
