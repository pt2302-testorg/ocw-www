course_description: 'This is an advanced topics course in model theory whose main
  theme is simple theories. We treat simple theories in the framework of compact abstract
  theories, which is more general than that of first order theories. We cover the
  basic properties of independence (i.e., non-dividing) in simple theories, the characterization
  of simple theories by the existence of a notion of independence, and hyperimaginary
  canonical bases.
