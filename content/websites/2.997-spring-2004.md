course_description: 'This course is an introduction to the theory and application
  of large-scale dynamic programming. Topics include Markov decision processes, dynamic
  programming algorithms, simulation-based algorithms, theory and algorithms for value
  function approximation, and policy search methods. The course examines games and
  applications in areas such as dynamic resource allocation, finance and queueing
  networks.
