course_description: "This class is divided into a series of sections or \"modules\"\
  , each of which concentrates on a particular large technology-related topic in a\
  \ cultural context. The class will start with a four-week module on Samurai Swords\
  \ and Blacksmithing, followed by smaller units on Chinese Cooking, the Invention\
  \ of Clocks, and Andean Weaving, and end with a four-week module on Automobiles\
  \ and Engines. In addition, there will be a series of hands-on projects that tie\
  \ theory and practice together. The class discussions range across anthropology,\
  \ history, and individual development, emphasizing recurring themes, such as the\
  \ interaction between technology and culture and the relation between \"skill\"\
  \ knowledge and \"craft\" knowledge.[  \n](http://esg.mit.edu/)\n\nCulture Tech\
  \ evolved from a more extensive, two-semester course which formed the centerpiece\
  \ of the Integrated Studies Program at MIT.\_ For 13 years, ISP was an alternative\
  \ first-year program combining humanities, physics, learning-by-doing, and weekly\
  \ luncheons.\_ Culture Tech represents the core principles of ISP distilled into\
  \ a 6-unit seminar. Although many collections of topics have been used over the\
  \ years, the modules presented here are a representative sequence.\n"
