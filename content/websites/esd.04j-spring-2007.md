course_description: 'This class provides an introduction to quantitative models and
  qualitative frameworks for studying complex engineering systems. Also taught is
  the art of abstracting a complex system into a model for purposes of analysis and
  design while dealing with complexity, emergent behavior, stochasticity, non-linearities
  and the requirements of many stakeholders with divergent objectives. The successful
  completion of the class requires a semester-long class project that deals with critical
  contemporary issues which require an integrative, interdisciplinary approach using
  the above models and frameworks.
