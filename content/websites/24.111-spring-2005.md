course_description: 'Quantum mechanics--even in the ordinary, non-relativistic, "particle"
  formulation that will be the primary focus of this course--has been a staggeringly
  successful physical theory, surely one of the crowning achievements of 20th century
  science. It''s also rather bizarre--bizarre enough to lead very intelligent and
  otherwise sensible people to make such claims as that the universe is perpetually
  splitting into many copies of itself, that conscious minds have the power to make
  physical systems "jump" in unpredictable ways, that classical logic stands in need
  of fundamental revision, and much, much more. In this course, we intelligent and
  sensible people will attempt to take a sober look at these and other alleged implications
  of quantum mechanics, as well as certain stubborn problems that continue to trouble
  its foundations.


  Along the way, we will take plenty of time out to discuss philosophical questions
  about science that quantum mechanics raises in new and interesting ways: e.g., what
  it means to attribute probabilities to physical events, what the aims of scientific
  inquiry are (does it aim at something true, or merely at something useful?), what
  the role of observation is in constructing a scientific theory, what it means to
  say that there is an "objective" physical world, whether something as basic as logic
  can be viewed as an empirical discipline, whether there can be meaningful scientific
  questions whose answers cannot possibly be settled by experiment, and more.
