course_description: 'This course deals with solid-state diffusion, homogeneous and
  heterogeneous chemical reactions, and spinodal decomposition. Topics covered include:
  heat conduction in solids, convective and radiative heat transfer boundary conditions;
  fluid dynamics, 1-D solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, boundary layer theory,
  turbulent flow, and coupling with heat conduction and diffusion in fluids to calculate
  heat and mass transfer coefficients.
