course_description: "This course provides a review of physical, chemical, ecological,\
  \ and economic principles used to examine interactions between humans and the natural\
  \ environment. Mass balance concepts are applied to ecology, chemical kinetics,\
  \ hydrology, and transportation; energy balance concepts are applied to building\
  \ design, ecology, and climate change; and economic and life cycle concepts are\
  \ applied to resource evaluation and engineering design. Numerical models are used\
  \ to integrate concepts and to assess environmental impacts of human activities.\
  \ Problem sets involve development of MATLAB\xAE models for particular engineering\
  \ applications. Some experience with computer programming is helpful but not essential.\n"
