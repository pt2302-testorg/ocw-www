course_description: 'This course covers the classical partial differential equations
  of applied mathematics: diffusion, Laplace/Poisson, and wave equations. It also
  includes methods and tools for solving these PDEs, such as separation of variables,
  Fourier series and transforms, eigenvalue problems, and Green''s functions.
