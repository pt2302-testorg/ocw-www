course_description: 'This course will cover fundamentals of digital communications
  and networking. We will study the basics of information theory, sampling and quantization,
  coding, modulation, signal detection and system performance in the presence of noise.
  The study of data networking will include multiple access, reliable packet transmission,
  routing and protocols of the internet. The concepts taught in class will be discussed
  in the context of aerospace communication systems: aircraft communications, satellite
  communications, and deep space communications.
