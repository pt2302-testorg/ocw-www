course_description: 'As the digital revolution brings with it radical changes in how
  and what we learn, people must continue to learn all the time. New technologies
  make possible new approaches to learning, new contexts for learning, new tools to
  support learning, and new ideas of what can be learned. This course will explore
  these new opportunities for learning with a special focus on what can be learned
  through immersive, hands-on activities. Students will participate in (and reflect
  on) a variety of learning situations, and will use Media Lab technologies to develop
  new workshops, iteratively run and refine the workshops, and analyze how and what
  the workshop participants learn.
