course_description: 'ERBA (ESD.72) emphasizes three methodologies - reliability and
  probabilistic risk assessment (RPRA), decision analysis (DA), and cost-benefit analysis
  (CBA). In this class, the issues of interest are: the risks associated with large
  engineering projects such as nuclear power reactors, the International Space Station,
  and critical infrastructures; the development of new products; the design of processes
  and operations with environmental externalities; and infrastructure renewal projects.
