course_description: 'Multi-scale systems (MuSS) consist of components from two or
  more length scales (nano, micro, meso, or macro-scales). In MuSS, the engineering
  modeling, design principles, and fabrication processes of the components are fundamentally
  different. The challenge is to make these components so they are conceptually and
  model-wise compatible with other-scale components with which they interface. This
  course covers the fundamental properties of scales, design theories, modeling methods
  and manufacturing issues which must be addressed in these systems. Examples of MuSS
  include precision instruments, nanomanipulators, fiber optics, micro/nano-photonics,
  nanorobotics, MEMS (piezoelectric driven manipulators and optics), X-Ray telescopes
  and carbon nano-tube assemblies. Students master the materials through problem sets
  and a project literature critique.
