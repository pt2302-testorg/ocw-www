course_description: '1.050 is a sophomore-level engineering mechanics course, commonly
  labelled "Statics and Strength of Materials" or "Solid Mechanics I." This course
  introduces students to the fundamental principles and methods of structural mechanics.
  Topics covered include: static equilibrium, force resultants, support conditions,
  analysis of determinate planar structures (beams, trusses, frames), stresses and
  strains in structural elements, states of stress (shear, bending, torsion), statically
  indeterminate systems, displacements and deformations, introduction to matrix methods,
  elastic stability, and approximate methods. Design exercises are used to encourage
  creative student initiative and systems thinking.
