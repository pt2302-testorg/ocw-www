course_description: "What can we learn about science and technology\u2013and what\
  \ can we do with that knowledge? Who are \"we\" in these questions?\u2013whose knowledge\
  \ and expertise gets made into public policy, new medicines, topics of cultural\
  \ and political discourse, science education, and so on? How can expertise and lay\
  \ knowledge about science and technology be reconciled in a democratic society?\
  \ How can we make sense of the interactions of living and non-living, humans and\
  \ non-humans, individual and collectivities in the production of scientific knowledge\
  \ and technologies?\n\nThe course takes these questions as entry points into an\
  \ ever-growing body of work to which feminist, anti-racist, and other critical analysts\
  \ and activists have made significant contributions. The course also takes these\
  \ questions as an invitation to practice challenging the barriers of expertise,\
  \ gender, race, class, and place that restrict wider access to and understanding\
  \ of the production of scientific knowledge and technologies. In that spirit, students\
  \ participate in an innovative, problem-based learning (PBL) approach that allows\
  \ them to shape their own directions of inquiry and develop their skills as investigators\
  \ and prospective teachers. At the same time the PBL cases engage students' critical\
  \ faculties as they learn about existing analyses of gender, race, and the complexities\
  \ of science and technology, guided by individualized bibliographies co-constructed\
  \ with the instructors and by the projects of the other students. Students from\
  \ all fields and levels of preparation are encouraged to join the course.\n"
