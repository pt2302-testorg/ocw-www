course_description: "In the western world, approximately 10\u201315% of couples suffer\
  \ from subfertility. Consequently, over 5 million babies have been born thanks to\
  \ assisted reproductive technologies, and more than half of those have been born\
  \ in the past six years alone. This class will cover the basic biology behind fertility\
  \ and explore the etiology of infertility. We will highlight open questions in reproductive\
  \ biology, familiarize students with both tried-and-true and emerging reproductive\
  \ technologies, and explore the advantages and pitfalls of each.\n\nThis course\
  \ is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
