course_description: 'This seminar is made possible through a collaboration between
  [Radius](http://radius.mit.edu/) and the [Philosophy](http://web.mit.edu/philosophy/)
  section of MIT. This course provides an opportunity to explore a wide range of ethical
  issues through guided discussions that are geared to equip students for ongoing
  reflection and action. Lectures and discussions with guest faculty, as well as attendance
  at on-and off-campus events, expose students to ethical problems and resources for
  addressing them. The course also encourages students to work collaboratively as
  they clarify their personal and vocational principles.


  Topics vary each term and reflect the interests of those enrolled.
