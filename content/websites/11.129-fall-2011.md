course_description: 'This course is designed to prepare you for a successful student
  teaching experience. Some of the major themes and activities are: analysis of yourself
  as a teacher and as a learner, subject knowledge, adolescent development, student
  learning styles, lesson planning, assessment strategies, classroom management techniques
  and differentiated instruction. The course requires significant personal involvement
  and time. You will observe high school classes, begin to pursue a more active role
  in the classroom in the latter part of the semester, do reflective writings on what
  you see and think (journal), design and teach a mini-lesson, design a major curriculum
  unit and engage in our classroom discussions and activities.
