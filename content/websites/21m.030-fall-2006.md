course_description: 'This course explores the ways that music is both shaped by and
  gives shape to the cultural settings in which it is performed, through studying
  selected musical traditions from around the world. Specific case studies will be
  examined closely through listening, analysis, and hands-on instruction. The syllabus
  centers around weekly listening assignments and readings from a textbook with CDs,
  supplemented by hands-on workshops, lecture/demonstrations and concerts by master
  musicians from around the world.
