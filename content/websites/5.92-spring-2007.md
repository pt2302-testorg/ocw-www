course_description: '"Energy, Environment and Society" is an opportunity for first-year
  students to make direct contributions to energy innovations at MIT and in local
  communities. The class takes a project-based approach, bringing student teams together
  to conduct studies that will help MIT, Cambridge and Boston to make tangible improvements
  in their energy management systems. Students will develop a thorough understanding
  of energy systems and their major components through guest lectures by researchers
  from across MIT and will apply that knowledge in their projects. Students are involved
  in all aspects of project design, from the refinement of research questions to data
  collection and analysis, conclusion drawing and presentation of findings. Each student
  team will work closely with experts including local stakeholders as well as leading
  technology companies throughout the development and implementation of their projects.
  Projects in this course center on renewable energy and energy efficiency.
