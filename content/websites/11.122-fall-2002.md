course_description: 'Modern industrial activities - which MIT engineers and scientists
  play a major role in - have significant environmental and social impacts. Trends
  towards further industrialization and globalization portend major challenges for
  society to manage the adverse impacts of our urban and industrial activities. How
  serious are current environmental and social problems? Why should we care about
  them? How are governments, corporations, activists, and ordinary citizens responding
  to these problems.


  This course examines environmental and social impacts of industrial society and
  policy responses. We will explore current trends in industrialization, urbanization,
  and globalization, analyze the impacts these trends have on human health, environmental
  sustainability, and equity, and then examine a range of policy options available
  for responding to current problems. The course will present key trends in both domestic
  and international contexts.


  We will examine four policy problems in particular during the course: (1) regulating
  industrial pollution; (2) regulating "sweatshops" and the broader impacts of globalization;
  (3) protecting ecosystems; and (4) protecting urban environments during development.
  We delve into specific cases of these challenges, including: chemical safety and
  toxins; computers, e-commerce, and the environment; biotech and society; sweatshops;
  and food production and consumption. Through these cases, we will explore underlying
  processes and drivers of environmental degradation. Finally, we will analyze opportunities
  and barriers to policy responses taken by governments, international institutions,
  corporations, non-governmental organizations, consumers, and impacted communities.
