course_description: 'Approaching transportation as a complex, large-scale, integrated,
  open system (CLIOS), this course strives to be an interdisciplinary systems subject
  in the "open" sense. It introduces qualitative modeling ideas and various techniques
  and philosophies of modeling complex transportation enterprises. It also introduces
  conceptual frameworks for qualitative analysis, such as frameworks for regional
  strategic planning, institutional change analysis, and new technology development
  and deployment. And it covers transportation as a large-scale, integrated system
  that interacts directly with the social, political, and economic aspects of contemporary
  society. Fundamental elements and issues shaping traveler and freight transportation
  systems are covered, along with underlying principles governing transportation planning,
  investment, operations, and maintenance.
