course_description: 'Business organizations and markets use a bewildering variety
  of structures to coordinate the productive activities of their stakeholders. Dramatic
  changes in information technology and the nature of economic competition are forcing
  firms to come up with new ways of organizing work. This course uses economic theory
  to investigate the roles of information and technology in the existing diversity
  of organizations and markets and in enabling the creating of new organizational
  forms.
