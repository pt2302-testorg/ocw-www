course_description: 'This course is an introduction to cognitive development focusing
  on children''s understanding of objects, agents, and causality. It develops a critical
  understanding of experimental design. The course discusses how developmental research
  might address philosophical questions about the origins of knowledge, appearance
  and reality, and the problem of other minds. It provides instruction and practice
  in written communication as needed for cognitive science research (including critical
  reviews of journal papers, a literature review and an original research proposal),
  as well as instruction and practice in oral communication in the form of a poster
  presentation of a journal paper.
