course_description: 'This course develops and applies scaling laws and the methods
  of continuum mechanics to biomechanical phenomena over a range of length scales.
  Topics include: structure of tissues and the molecular basis for macroscopic properties;
  chemical and electrical effects on mechanical behavior; cell mechanics, motility
  and adhesion; biomembranes; biomolecular mechanics and molecular motors. Experimental
  methods for probing structures at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels will
  also be investigated.


  This course was originally co-developed by Professors Alan Grodzinsky, Roger Kamm,
  and L. Mahadevan.
