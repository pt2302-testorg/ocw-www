course_description: 'During development, the genetic content of each cell remains,
  with a few exceptions, identical to that of the zygote. Most differentiated cells
  therefore retain all of the genetic information necessary to generate an entire
  organism. It was through pioneering technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer
  (SCNT) that this concept was experimentally proven. Only 10 years ago the sheep
  Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult organism, demonstrating that
  the differentiated state of a mammalian cell can be fully reversible to a pluripotent
  embryonic state. A key conclusion from these experiments was that the difference
  between pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and unipotent differentiated
  cells is solely a consequence of reversible changes. These changes, which have proved
  to involve reversible alterations to both DNA and to proteins that bind DNA, are
  known as epigenetic, to distinguish them from genetic alterations to DNA sequence.
  In this course we will explore such epigenetic changes and study different approaches
  that can return a differentiated cell to an embryonic state in a process referred
  to as epigenetic reprogramming, which will ultimately allow generation of patient-specific
  stem cells and application to regenerative therapy.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
