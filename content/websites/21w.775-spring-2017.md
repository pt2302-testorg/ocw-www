course_description: "In this course we will read and write about works that explore\
  \ symbolic encounters in the American landscape. Some of the assigned works look\
  \ at uneasy encounters between ordinary individuals and animals\u2014wolves, eagles,\
  \ sandhill cranes\u2014that Americans have invested with symbolic significance;\
  \ others explore conflicts between the pragmatic American impulse to impose order\
  \ on unruly nature and the equally American inclination to enshrine the unaltered\
  \ landscape.\n"
