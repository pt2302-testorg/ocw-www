course_description: 'This class introduces elementary programming concepts including
  variable types, data structures, and flow control. After an introduction to linear
  algebra and probability, it covers numerical methods relevant to mechanical engineering,
  including approximation (interpolation, least squares and statistical regression),
  integration, solution of linear and nonlinear equations, ordinary differential equations,
  and deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Examples are drawn from mechanical
  engineering disciplines, in particular from robotics, dynamics, and structural analysis.
