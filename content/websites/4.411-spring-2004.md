course_description: 'In this class, concepts of building technology and experimental
  methods are studied, in class and in lab assignments. Projects vary yearly and have
  included design and testing of strategies for daylighting, passive heating and cooling,
  and improved indoor air quality via natural ventilation. Experimental methods focus
  on measurement and analysis of thermally driven and wind-driven airflows, lighting
  intensity and glare, and heat flow and thermal storage. Experiments are conducted
  at model and full scale and are often motivated by ongoing field work in developing
  countries.
