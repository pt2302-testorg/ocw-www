course_description: "This is an introductory course in Discrete Mathematics oriented\
  \ toward Computer Science and Engineering. The course divides roughly into thirds:\n\
  \n1.  Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics: Definitions, Proofs, Sets, Functions,\
  \ Relations\n2.  Discrete Structures: Modular Arithmetic, Graphs, State Machines,\
  \ Counting\n3.  Discrete Probability Theory\n\nA version of this course from a\_\
  previous term\_was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)\
  \ (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5512 (Mathematics for Computer Science).\n"
