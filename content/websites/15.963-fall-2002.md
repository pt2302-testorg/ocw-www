course_description: 'The course is structured around a core of fundamental concepts
  concerning how we view organizations, and the application of these concepts to basic
  domains of action crucial for contemporary businesses: sensemaking, learning, knowing,
  and change. We view organizations as enacted systems, wherein humans are continually
  shaping the structures that influence their action in turn. In other words, we create
  the systems that then create us.
