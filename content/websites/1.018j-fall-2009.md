course_description: 'We will cover fundamentals of ecology, considering Earth as an
  integrated dynamic system. Topics include coevolution of the biosphere, geosphere,
  atmosphere and oceans; photosynthesis and respiration; the hydrologic, carbon and
  nitrogen cycles. We will examine the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems;
  regulation of the distribution and abundance of organisms; structure and function
  of ecosystems, including evolution and natural selection; metabolic diversity; productivity;
  trophic dynamics; models of population growth, competition, mutualism and predation.
  This course is designated as Communication-Intensive; instruction and practice in
  oral and written communication provided. Biology is a recommended prerequisite.
