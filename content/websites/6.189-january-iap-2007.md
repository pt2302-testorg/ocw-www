course_description: 'The course serves as an introductory course in parallel programming.
  It offers a series of lectures on parallel programming concepts as well as a group
  project providing hands-on experience with parallel programming. The students will
  have the unique opportunity to use the cutting-edge PLAYSTATION 3 development platform
  as they learn how to design and implement exciting applications for multicore architectures.
  At the end of the course, students will have an understanding of:


  *   Fundamental design philosophies that multicore architectures address.

  *   Parallel programming philosophies and emerging best practices.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month. The course can be tailored to a normal semester time line.
