course_description: 'This course focuses on the latest scientific developments and
  discoveries in the field of nanomechanics, the study of forces and motion on extremely
  tiny (10{{< sup "\\-9" >}} m) areas of synthetic and biological materials and structures.
  At this level, mechanical properties are intimately related to chemistry, physics,
  and quantum mechanics. Most lectures will consist of a theoretical component that
  will then be compared to recent experimental data (case studies) in the literature.
  The course begins with a series of introductory lectures that describes the normal
  and lateral forces acting at the atomic scale. The following discussions include
  experimental techniques in high resolution force spectroscopy, atomistic aspects
  of adhesion, nanoindentation, molecular details of fracture, chemical force microscopy,
  elasticity of single macromolecular chains, intermolecular interactions in polymers,
  dynamic force spectroscopy, biomolecular bond strength measurements, and molecular
  motors.
