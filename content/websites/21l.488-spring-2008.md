course_description: "Central to our era is the gradual movement of all the world's\
  \ regions toward a uniform standard of economic and political development. In this\
  \ class we will read a variety of recent narratives that partake of, dissent from,\
  \ or contribute to this story, ranging from novels and poems to World Bank and IMF\
  \ statements and National Geographic reports. We will seek to understand the many\
  \ motives and voices \u2013 sometimes congruent, sometimes clashing \u2013 that\
  \ are currently engaged in producing accounts of people in the developing world:\
  \ their hardships, laughter, and courage, and how they help themselves and are helped\
  \ by outsiders who may or may not have philanthropic motives. Readings will include\
  \ literature by J. G. Ballard, Jamaica Kincaid, Rohinton Mistry, and John le Carr\xE9\
  , as well as policy documents, newspaper and magazine articles, and the Web sites\
  \ of a variety of trade and development commissions and organizations.\n"
