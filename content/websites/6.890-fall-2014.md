course_description: "6.890 Algorithmic Lower Bounds: Fun with Hardness Proofs is a\
  \ class taking a practical approach to proving problems can't be solved efficiently\
  \ (in polynomial time and assuming standard complexity-theoretic assumptions like\
  \ P\_\u2260\_NP). The class focuses on reductions and techniques for proving problems\
  \ are computationally hard for a variety of complexity classes. Along the way, the\
  \ class will create many interesting gadgets, learn many hardness proof styles,\
  \ explore the connection between games and computation, survey several important\
  \ problems and complexity classes, and crush hopes and dreams (for fast optimal\
  \ solutions).\n"
