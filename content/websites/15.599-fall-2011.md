course_description: "Diversity begets creativity\u2014in this seminar we tap the amazing\
  \ power of swarm creativity on the Web by studying and working together as Collaborative\
  \ Innovation Networks (COINs). As interdisciplinary teams of MIT management, SCAD\
  \ design, University of Cologne informatics, and Aalto University software engineering\
  \ students we will explore how to discover latest trends on the Web, and how to\
  \ make them succeed in online social networks. We study a wide range of methods\
  \ for predictive analytics (coolhunting) and online social marketing (coolfarming),\
  \ mostly based on social network analysis and the emerging science of collaboration.\
  \ Students will also learn to use our own unique MIT-developed Condor tool for Web\
  \ mining, social network analysis, and trend prediction.\n"
