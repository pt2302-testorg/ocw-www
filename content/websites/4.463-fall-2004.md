course_description: 'This course addresses advanced structures, exterior envelopes
  and contemporary production technologies. It continues the exploration of structural
  elements and systems, and expands to include more complex determinate, indeterminate,
  long-span and high-rise systems. It covers topics such as reinforced concrete, steel
  and engineered wood design, and provides an introduction to tensile systems. Lectures
  also address the contemporary exterior envelope with an emphasis on their performance
  attributes and advanced manufacturing technologies. This course is required of MArch
  students.
