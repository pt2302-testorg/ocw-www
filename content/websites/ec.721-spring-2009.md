course_description: 'According to the [United States Agency for International Development](http://www.usaid.gov/),
  20 million people in developing countries require wheelchairs, and the [United Nations
  Development Programme](http://www.undp.org/) estimates below 1% of their need is
  being met in Africa by local production. Wheelchair Design in Developing Countries
  (WDDC) gives students the chance to better the lives of others by improving wheelchairs
  and tricycles made in the developing world. Lectures will focus on understanding
  local factors, such as operating environments, social stigmas against the disabled,
  and manufacturing constraints, and then applying sound scientific/engineering knowledge
  to develop appropriate technical solutions. Multidisciplinary student teams will
  conduct term-long projects on topics such as hardware design, manufacturing optimization,
  biomechanics modeling, and business plan development. Theory will further be connected
  to real-world implementation during guest lectures by MIT faculty, Third-World community
  partners, and U.S. wheelchair organizations.
