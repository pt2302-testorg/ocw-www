course_description: 'This is a seminar on "self-knowledge" -- knowledge of one''s
  own mental states. In addition to reading some of the classic papers on self-knowledge,
  we will look at some very recent work on the topic. There will be no lectures. Each
  week I will spend half an hour or so introducing the assigned reading, and the rest
  of the time will be devoted to discussion.
