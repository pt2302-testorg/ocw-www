course_description: 'This course models multi-domain engineering systems at a level
  of detail suitable for design and control system implementation. Topics include
  network representation, state-space models; multi-port energy storage and dissipation,
  Legendre transforms; nonlinear mechanics, transformation theory, Lagrangian and
  Hamiltonian forms; and control-relevant properties. Application examples may include
  electro-mechanical transducers, mechanisms, electronics, fluid and thermal systems,
  compressible flow, chemical processes, diffusion, and wave transmission.
