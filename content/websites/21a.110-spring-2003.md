course_description: 'This course introduces students to some of the major social theories
  and debates that inspire and inform anthropological analysis. Over the course of
  the semester, we will investigate a range of theoretical propositions concerning
  such topics as agency, structure, subjectivity, history, social change, power, culture,
  and the politics of representation. Ultimately, all theories can be read as statements
  about human beings and the worlds they create and inhabit. We will approach each
  theoretical perspective or proposition on three levels: (1) in terms of its analytical
  or explanatory power for understanding human behavior and the social world; (2)
  in the context of the social and historical circumstances in which they were produced;
  and (3) as contributions to ongoing dialogues and debate.
