course_description: 'A millennial challenge in biology is to decipher how vast arrays
  of molecular interactions inside the cell work in concert to produce a cellular
  function. Systems biology, a new interdisciplinary field of science, brings together
  biologists and physicists to tackle this grand challenge through quantitative experiments
  and models. In this course, we will discuss the unifying principles that all organisms
  use to perform cellular functions. We will also discuss key challenges faced by
  a cell in both single and multi-cellular organisms. Finally, we will discuss how
  researchers in the field of synthetic biology are using the new knowledge gained
  from studying naturally-occurring biological systems to create artificial gene networks
  capable of performing new functions.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
