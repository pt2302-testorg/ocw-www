course_description: "This subject is a computer-oriented introduction to probability\
  \ and data analysis. It is designed to give students the knowledge and practical\
  \ experience they need to interpret lab and field data. Basic probability concepts\
  \ are introduced at the outset because they provide a systematic way to describe\
  \ uncertainty. They form the basis for the analysis of quantitative data in science\
  \ and engineering. The MATLAB\xAE programming language is used to perform virtual\
  \ experiments and to analyze real-world data sets, many downloaded from the web.\
  \ Programming applications include display and assessment of data sets, investigation\
  \ of hypotheses, and identification of possible casual relationships between variables.\
  \ This is the first semester that two courses, Computing and Data Analysis for Environmental\
  \ Applications (1.017) and Uncertainty in Engineering (1.010),\_are being\_jointly\
  \ offered\_and taught as a single course.\n"
