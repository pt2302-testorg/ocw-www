course_description: 'Sperm are tiny, haploid cells with a supremely important job:
  They deliver the paternal genome to the egg, helping create a zygote that develops
  into a new individual. For a human male, however, only a small fraction of the sperm
  produced will ever fertilize an egg. Sperm thus experience intense selective pressure:
  They must compete against each other, navigate a foreign environment in the female
  reproductive tract, and interact specifically and appropriately with the surface
  of the egg. These selective pressures can drive extreme changes in morphology and
  gene function over short evolutionary time scales, resulting in amazing diversity
  among species. In this course, we will explore the ways in which these unique evolutionary
  forces contribute to incredible specializations of sperm form and function, including
  hook-shaped heads and multiple tails. Students will learn from the primary research
  literature with an emphasis on rigorously interpreting experimental data and critiquing
  analyses and conclusions.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
