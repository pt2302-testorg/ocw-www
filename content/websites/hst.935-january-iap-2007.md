course_description: 'This eight-session course, designed for a mixed group of first,
  second, third and fourth-year medical students, uses literary narratives and poetry
  to study ethical issues in medicine. This methodology emphasizes the importance
  of context, contingency, and circumstances in recognizing, evaluating, and resolving
  moral problems. The seminar will focus on developing the skills of critical and
  reflective reading that increase effectiveness in clinical medicine. Texts will
  include short fiction and poetry by authors such as Woolf, Chekhov, Carver, Kafka,
  Hurston, Marquez and Tolstoy. The instructor will provide necessary philosophic
  and literary context at the beginning of each session, the balance devoted to class
  discussion. During the course, students will keep a reading journal that examines
  the meanings of illness, the moral role of the physician, and the relevance of emotions,
  culture, faith, values, social realities, and life histories to patient care.
