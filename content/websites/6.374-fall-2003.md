course_description: '6.374 examines the device and circuit level optimization of digital
  building blocks. Topics covered include: MOS device models including Deep Sub-Micron
  effects; circuit design styles for logic, arithmetic and sequential blocks; estimation
  and minimization of energy consumption; interconnect models and parasitics; device
  sizing and logical effort; timing issues (clock skew and jitter) and active clock
  distribution techniques; memory architectures, circuits (sense amplifiers) and devices;
  testing of integrated circuits. The course employs extensive use of circuit layout
  and SPICE in design projects and software labs.
