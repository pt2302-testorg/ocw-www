course_description: 'This course is an an exploration of British culture and politics,
  focusing on the changing role of the monarchy from the accession of the House of
  Hanover (later Windsor) in 1714 to the present. The dynasty has encountered a series
  of crises, in which the personal and the political have been inextricably combined:
  for example, George III''s mental illness; the scandalous behavior of his son, George
  IV; Victoria''s withdrawal from public life after the death of Prince Albert; the
  abdication of Edward VIII; and the public antagonism sparked by sympathy for Diana,
  Princess of Wales.
