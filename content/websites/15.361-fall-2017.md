course_description: 'This course provides business students an alternative to the
  mechanistic view of strategy execution that reframes an organization as a complex
  network of teams continuously adjusting to market conditions and to other teams.
  The Flexible Execution Model is introduced consisting of seven elements that together
  shape how well an organization executes its strategy. Practical tools that help
  leaders achieve their organizations'' strategic priorities are discussed. The course
  also explores novel ways to use data including surveys, Glassdoor reviews, and other
  sources to measure strategy execution and identify what is and is not working.
