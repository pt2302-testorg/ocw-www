course_description: 'This is an advanced course on modeling, design, integration and
  best practices for use of machine elements such as bearings, springs, gears, cams
  and mechanisms. Modeling and analysis of these elements is based upon extensive
  application of physics, mathematics and core mechanical engineering principles (solid
  mechanics, fluid mechanics, manufacturing, estimation, computer simulation, etc.).
  These principles are reinforced via (1) hands-on laboratory experiences wherein
  students conduct experiments and disassemble machines and (2) a substantial design
  project wherein students model, design, fabricate and characterize a mechanical
  system that is relevant to a real world application. Students master the materials
  via problems sets that are directly related to, and coordinated with, the deliverables
  of their project. Student assessment is based upon mastery of the course materials
  and the student''s ability to synthesize, model and fabricate a mechanical device
  subject to engineering constraints (e.g. cost and time/schedule).
