course_description: 'This course examines the modern definition of freedom, and the
  obligations that people accept in honoring it. It investigates how these obligations
  are captured in the principles of our political associations. This course also studies
  how the centrality of freedom plays out in the political thought of such authors
  as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke and Montesquieu, as well as debating which notions
  of freedom inspire and sustain the American experiment by careful reading of the
  documents and arguments of the founding of the United States.


  This course is part of the [Concourse](http://web.mit.edu/concourse/www/) program
  at MIT.
