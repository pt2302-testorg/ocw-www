course_description: 'This course introduces students to methods and background needed
  for the conceptual design of continuously operating chemical plants. Particular
  attention is paid to the use of process modeling tools such as Aspen that are used
  in industry and to problems of current interest. Each student team is assigned to
  evaluate and design a different technology and prepare a final design report.


  For spring 2006, the theme of the course is to design technologies for lowering
  the emissions of climatically active gases from processes that use coal as the primary
  fuel.
