course_description: 'Traditional finance and other business courses analyze a broad
  spectrum of factors affecting business decision-making but typically give little
  systematic consideration to the role of taxes. In contrast, traditional tax accounting
  courses concentrate on administrative issues while ignoring the richness of the
  context in which tax factors operate. The objective of the course is to bridge this
  gap by providing a framework for recognizing tax planning opportunities and applying
  basic principles of tax strategy.
