course_description: 'This course applies the concepts of reaction rate, stoichiometry
  and equilibrium to the analysis of chemical and biological reacting systems, derivation
  of rate expressions from reaction mechanisms and equilibrium or steady state assumptions,
  design of chemical and biochemical reactors via synthesis of chemical kinetics,
  transport phenomena, and mass and energy balances. Topics covered include: chemical/biochemical
  pathways; enzymatic, pathway, and cell growth kinetics; batch, plug flow and well-stirred
  reactors for chemical reactions and cultivations of microorganisms and mammalian
  cells; heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis; heat and mass transport in reactors,
  including diffusion to and within catalyst particles and cells or immobilized enzymes.
