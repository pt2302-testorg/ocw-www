course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the mechanics of solids
  with applications to science and engineering. We emphasize the three essential features
  of all mechanics analyses, namely: (a) the geometry of the motion and/or deformation
  of the structure, and conditions of geometric fit, (b) the forces on and within
  structures and assemblages; and (c) the physical aspects of the structural system
  (including material properties) which quantify relations between the forces and
  motions/deformation.
