course_description: 'The course, which spans two thirds of a semester, provides students
  with a research-inspired laboratory experience that introduces standard biochemical
  techniques in the context of investigating a current and exciting research topic,
  acquired resistance to the cancer drug Gleevec. Techniques include protein expression,
  purification, and gel analysis, PCR, site-directed mutagenesis, kinase activity
  assays, and protein structure viewing.


  This class is part of the new laboratory curriculum in the MIT Department of Chemistry.
  Undergraduate Research-Inspired Experimental Chemistry Alternatives ([URIECA](http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/www/academic/urieca.html))
  introduces students to cutting edge research topics in a modular format.


  ##### Acknowledgments


  Development of this course was funded through an HHMI Professors grant to Professor
  Catherine L. Drennan.
