course_description: 'What do the organisms of the biosphere, specifically microorganisms,
  have to offer to biotechnological endeavors? In this course we will focus on the
  production of biomolecules using microbial systems. We will discuss potential growth
  substrates (such as agricultural waste and carbon dioxide) that can be used and
  learn about both established and cutting-edge manipulation techniques in the field
  of synthetic biology. We will also cover the production of biofuels, bioplastics,
  amino acids (e.g. lysine), food additives (e.g. monosodium glutamate, MSG), specialty
  chemicals (e.g. succinate), and biopharmaceuticals (e.g. plasmids for gene therapy).


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
