course_description: "This course explores the historical origins of the Japanese warrior\
  \ class as well as its reinvention throughout the archipelago's history, with a\
  \ special focus on the pre-modern era (200\u20131600 CE). It highlights key historical\
  \ contexts including the rise of the imperial court, interactions with the broader\
  \ world, and the establishment of a warrior-dominated state. It also considers the\
  \ modern imaginations and uses of the warrior figure.\n\nNote: This course is taught\
  \ in English with a project that requires research in Japanese."
