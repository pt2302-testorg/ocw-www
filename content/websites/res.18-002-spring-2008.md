course_description: "This course was offered as a non-credit program during the [Independent\
  \ Activities Period (IAP)](http://web.mit.edu/iap/about/index.html), January 2008.\
  \ A more recent version is available as course [_18.S997 Introduction To MATLAB\
  \ Programming_](/courses/18-s997-introduction-to-matlab-programming-fall-2011/),\
  \ including video lectures.\n\nThe course, intended for students with no programming\
  \ experience, provides the foundations of programming in MATLAB\xAE. Variables,\
  \ arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, and plots are explained. At\
  \ the end of the course, students should be able to use MATLAB in their own work,\
  \ and be prepared to deepen their MATLAB programming skills and tackle other languages\
  \ for computing, such as Java, C++, or Python.\n\nThe course mostly follows the\
  \ official [MATLAB Manual](http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/pdf_doc/matlab/getstart.pdf),\
  \ available from [The MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com/). We will cover material\
  \ from chapters 2-5.\n"
