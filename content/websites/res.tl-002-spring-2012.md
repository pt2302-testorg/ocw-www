course_description: 'The Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR) program
  at MIT seeks to bridge the divide between scientific research and the classroom.
  Understanding and applying research methods in the classroom setting can be challenging
  due to time constraints and the need for advanced equipment and facilities. The
  multidisciplinary STAR team collaborates with faculty from MIT and other educational
  institutions to design software exploring core scientific research concepts. The
  goal of STAR is to develop innovative and intuitive teaching tools for classroom
  use.


  All of the STAR educational tools are freely available. To complement the educational
  software, the STAR website contains curriculum components/modules which can facilitate
  the use of STAR educational tools in a variety of educational settings. Students,
  teachers, and professors should feel welcome to download software and curriculum
  modules for their own use.
