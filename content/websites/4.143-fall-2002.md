course_description: 'This studio proposes to engage tectonics as a material process.
  By exploring transformation, indeterminacy and mutability inherent in material and
  landscape processes, students will be challenged to engage notions of duration as
  a design strategy for architecture and urbanism. While the second law of thermodynamics
  states that the material universe tends toward a state of increasing disorder, architects
  build and construct in opposition to these forces. Attempting to delay the processes
  of disorder, decay and collapse, tectonics is often seen as the embodied expression
  of an arrested moment the finite resolution of the building process. Yet the processes
  that enable and disable architecture extend beyond any arrested moment.


  A more detailed description can be found in the syllabus section.
