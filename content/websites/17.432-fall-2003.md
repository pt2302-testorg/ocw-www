course_description: 'This course explores the causes of modern war with a focus on
  preventable causes. Course readings cover theoretical, historical, and methodological
  topics. Major theories of war are explored and assessed in the first few weeks of
  the class, asking at each stage "are these good theories?" and "how could they be
  tested?" Basic social scientific inference -- what are theories? What are good theories?
  How should theories be framed and tested? -- and case study methodology are also
  discussed. The second half of the course explores the history of the outbreak of
  some major wars. We use these cases as raw material for case studies, asking "if
  these episodes were the subject of case studies, how should those studies be performed,
  and what could be learned from them?"
