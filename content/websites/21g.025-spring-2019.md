course_description: 'This course considers how, despite its immense diversity, Africa
  continues to hold purchase as both a geographical entity and meaningful knowledge
  category. It examines the relationship between articulations of "Africa" and projects
  like European imperialism, developments in the biological sciences, African de-colonization
  and state-building, and the imagining of the planet''s future. Readings in anthropology
  and history are organized around five themes: space and place, race, representation,
  self-determination, and time.
