course_description: "This course focuses on novels and films from the last twenty-five\
  \ years (nominally 1985\u20132010) marked by their relationship to extreme violence\
  \ and transgression. Our texts will focus on serial killers, torture, rape, and\
  \ brutality, but they also explore notions of American history, gender and sexuality,\
  \ and reality television\u2014sometimes, they delve into love or time or the redemptive\
  \ role of art in late modernity. Our works are a motley assortment, with origins\
  \ in the U.S., France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Japan and South Korea. The broad\
  \ global era marked by this period is one of acceleration, fragmentation, and late\
  \ capitalism; however, we will also consider national specificities of violent representation,\
  \ including particulars like the history of racism in the United States, the role\
  \ of politeness in bourgeois Austrian culture, and the effect of Japanese manga\
  \ on vividly graphic contemporary Asian cinema.\n\nWe will explore the politics\
  \ and aesthetics of the extreme; affective questions about sensation, fear, disgust,\
  \ and shock; and problems of torture, pain, and the unrepresentable. We will ask\
  \ whether these texts help us understand violence, or whether they frame violence\
  \ as something that resists comprehension; we will consider whether form mitigates\
  \ or colludes with violence. Finally, we will continually press on the central term\
  \ in the title of this course: what, specifically, is violence? (Can we only speak\
  \ of plural \"violences\"?) Is violence the same as force? Do we know violence when\
  \ we see it? Is it something knowable or does it resist or even destroy knowledge?\
  \ Is violence a matter for a text's content\u2014who does what, how, and to whom\u2014\
  or is it a problem of form: shock, boredom, repetition, indeterminacy, blankness?\
  \ Can we speak of an aesthetic of violence? A politics or ethics of violence? Note\
  \ the question that titles our last week: Is it the case that we are what we see?\
  \ If so, what does our obsession with ultraviolence mean, and how does contemporary\
  \ representation turn an accusing gaze back at us?\n"
