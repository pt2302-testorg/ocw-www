course_description: 'This course aims to connect the principles, concepts, and laws/postulates
  of classical and statistical thermodynamics to applications that require quantitative
  knowledge of thermodynamic properties from a macroscopic to a molecular level. It
  covers their basic postulates of classical thermodynamics and their application
  to transient open and closed systems, criteria of stability and equilibria, as well
  as constitutive property models of pure materials and mixtures emphasizing molecular-level
  effects using the formalism of statistical mechanics. Phase and chemical equilibria
  of multicomponent systems are covered. Applications are emphasized through extensive
  problem work relating to practical cases.
