course_description: 'Understanding the brain''s remarkable ability for visual object
  recognition is one of the greatest challenges of brain research. The goal of this
  course is to provide an overview of key issues of object representation and to survey
  data from primate physiology and human fMRI that bear on those issues. Topics include
  the computational problems of object representation, the nature of object representations
  in the brain, the tolerance and selectivity of those representations, and the effects
  of attention and learning.
