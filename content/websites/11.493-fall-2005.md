course_description: 'This course is designed to offer an advanced introduction to
  key legal issues that arise in the area of property and land-use in American law,
  with a comparative focus on the laws of India and South Africa. The focus of the
  course is not on law itself, but on the policy implications of various rules, doctrines
  and practices which are covered in great detail. Legal rules regulating property
  are among the most fundamental to American, and most other, economies and societies.
  The main focus is on American property and land use law due to its prominence in
  international development policy and practice as a model, though substantial comparative
  legal materials are also introduced from selected non-western countries such as
  India and South Africa.
