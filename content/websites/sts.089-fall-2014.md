course_description: 'What do technology and innovation mean from Africa? This is the
  central question of this course, which tackles a double absence: Of the meanings
  and role of technology in African history, on the one hand, and of Africa''s place
  in the global history of technology, on the other. This course alternates between
  technologies from outside and technologies from within Africa and their itineraries
  in everyday life, and it is designed to provide students with grounded understandings
  of technology in Africa for intellectual and action-oriented purposes.
