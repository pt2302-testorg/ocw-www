course_description: 'This course deals with structural components in nuclear power
  plant systems, their functional purposes, operating conditions, and mechanical-structural
  design requirements. It combines mechanics techniques with models of material behavior
  to determine adequacy of component design. Considerations include mechanical loading,
  brittle fracture, in-elastic behavior, elevated temperatures, neutron irradiation,
  and seismic effects.
