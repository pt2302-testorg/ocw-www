course_description: "Algebra I is the first semester of a year-long introduction to\
  \ modern algebra. Algebra is a fundamental subject, used in many advanced math courses\
  \ and with applications in computer science, chemistry, etc. The focus of this class\
  \ is studying groups, linear algebra, and geometry in different forms.\n\nThese\
  \ notes, which were created by students in a recent on-campus 18.701 Algebra I class,\
  \ are offered here to supplement the materials included in OCW\u2019s [version of\
  \ 18.701](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-701-algebra-i-fall-2010/). They have not\
  \ been checked for accuracy by the instructors of that class or by other MIT faculty\
  \ members."
