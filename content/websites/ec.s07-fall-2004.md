course_description: 'This class will study the behavior of photovoltaic solar energy
  systems, focusing on the behavior of "stand-alone" systems. The design of stand-alone
  photovoltaic systems will be covered. This will include estimation of costs and
  benefits, taking into account any available government subsidies. Introduction to
  the hardware elements and their behavior will be included.
