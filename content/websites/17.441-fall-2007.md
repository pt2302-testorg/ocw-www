course_description: "This course examines the interconnections of international politics\
  \ and climate change. Beginning with an analysis of the strategic and environmental\
  \ legacies of the 20th Century, it explores the politicization of the natural environment,\
  \ the role of science in this process, and the gradual shifts in political concerns\
  \ to incorporate \"nature\". Two general thrusts of climate-politics connections\
  \ are pursued, namely those related to (a) conflict \u2013 focusing on threats to\
  \ security due to environmental dislocations and (b) cooperation \u2013 focusing\
  \ on the politics of international treaties that have contributed to emergent processes\
  \ for global accord in response to evidence of climate change. The course concludes\
  \ by addressing the question of: \"What Next?\"\n"
