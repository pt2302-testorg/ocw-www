course_description: "This course is a three-course series that provides an introduction\
  \ to the theory and practice of quantum computation.\_The three-course series comprises:\n\
  \n[8.370.1x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/about):\
  \ Foundations of Quantum and Classical computing\u2014quantum mechanics, reversible\
  \ computation, and quantum measurement  \n[8.370.2x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.2x+1T2018/about):\
  \ Simple Quantum Protocols and Algorithms\u2014teleportation and superdense coding,\
  \ the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon\u2019s algorithm, Grover\u2019s quantum search algorithm,\
  \ and Shor\u2019s quantum factoring algorithm  \n[8.370.3x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.3x+1T2018/about):\
  \ Foundations of Quantum communication\u2014noise and quantum channels, and quantum\
  \ key distribution\n\nPrior knowledge of quantum mechanics is helpful but not required.\
  \ It is best if you know some linear algebra.\n\nThis course was organized as a\
  \ three-part series on [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx) by MIT\u2019s Department\
  \ of Physics and is now archived on the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each module\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling.\n"
