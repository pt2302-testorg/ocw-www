course_description: 'Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems
  that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals
  move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss
  of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete
  control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural
  dynamics of our machines.


  This course discusses nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical
  systems, with an emphasis on machine learning methods. Topics include nonlinear
  dynamics of passive robots (walkers, swimmers, flyers), motion planning, partial
  feedback linearization, energy-shaping control, analytical optimal control, reinforcement
  learning/approximate optimal control, and the influence of mechanical design on
  control. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion,
  compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.
