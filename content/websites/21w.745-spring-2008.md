course_description: 'This course is a workshop for students with some experience in
  writing essays, nonfiction prose. Our focus will be negotiating and representing
  identities grounded in gender, race, class, nationality, sexuality, and other categories
  of identity, either our own or others'', in prose that is expository, exploratory,
  investigative, persuasive, lyrical, or incantatory. We will read nonfiction prose
  works by a wide array of writers who have used language to negotiate and represent
  aspects of identity and the ways the different determinants of identity intersect,
  compete, and cooperate.
