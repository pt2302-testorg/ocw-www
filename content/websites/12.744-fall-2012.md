course_description: 'The objective of this course is to develop an understanding of
  principles of marine isotope geochemistry, its systematics, and its application
  to the study of the behavior and history of the oceans within the earth system.
  The emphasis is on developing the underlying concepts and theory as well as proficiency
  in working with practical isotope systems. The course is divided into four sections:
  nuclear systematics, Earth formation and evolution, stable isotopes, and applications
  to the ocean system.
