course_description: 'This course is the second semester in the statistics sequence
  for political science and public policy offered in the Political Science Department
  at MIT. The intellectual thrust of the course is a presentation of statistical models
  for estimating causal effects of variables. The model of an effect is a conditional
  mean (though we might imagine other effect). The notion of causality is the effect
  of one variable on another holding all else constant.
