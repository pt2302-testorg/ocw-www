course_description: "This pass/fail seminar should be a fun setting where we can all\
  \ enjoy a love of good books together. Students will read approximately one novel\
  \ every two weeks, and the class will discuss each novel in a relaxed and interactive\
  \ setting, with attention to whatever themes and issues interest them most about\
  \ each book. We will read a wide mixture of classic and contemporary novels written\
  \ by women, including: Edith Wharton, _The House of Mirth_; Toni Morrison, _Jazz_;\
  \ Virginia Woolf, _Mrs. Dalloway_; Alice Walker, _The Color Purple_; Charlotte Bront\xEB\
  , _Jane Eyre_; Sheri Reynolds, _The Rapture of Canaan_; Jane Austen, _Pride and\
  \ Prejudice_; and Sylvia Plath, _The Bell Jar_. Recurrent issues likely to be discussed\
  \ include: gender, race, and class; romance, love, and marriage; depression and\
  \ suicide; and conception, childbirth, and parenthood.\n"
