course_description: 'The United States Congress is the most open of the national branches
  of government, and therefore the most closely studied. This course aims to find
  ways to deal with the vast array of information we have about Congress by asking
  two basic questions: What does Congress do (and why), and what are the various ways
  of studying congressional behavior? This course focuses on both the internal processes
  of the House and Senate, and on the place of Congress in the American political
  system.
