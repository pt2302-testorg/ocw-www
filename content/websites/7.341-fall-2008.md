course_description: 'Cellular responses to DNA damage constitute one of the most important
  fields in cancer biology. In this class we will analyze classical and recent papers
  from the primary research literature to gain a profound understand of cell cycle
  regulation and DNA damage checkpoints that act as powerful emergency brakes to prevent
  cancer.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
