course_description: "This course applies microeconomic theory to analysis of public\
  \ policy. It builds from the microeconomic model of consumer behavior and extends\
  \ to operation of single and multiple markets and analysis of why markets sometimes\
  \ fail. We will study empirical examples to evaluate theory, focusing on the casual\
  \ effects of policy interventions on economic outcomes. Topics include minimum wages\
  \ and employment, food stamps and consumer welfare, economics of risk and safety\
  \ regulation, the value of education, and gains from international trade.\n\n**MITx\
  \ Online Version**\n\nThis course is part of the Micromaster\u2019s Program in Data,\

  \ to audit, though learners have the option to pay a fee, which is based on the\
