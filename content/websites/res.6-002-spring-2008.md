course_description: 'This text is an introductory treatment on the junior level for
  a two-semester electrical engineering course starting from the Coulomb-Lorentz force
  law on a point charge. The theory is extended by the continuous superposition of
  solutions from previously developed simpler problems leading to the general integral
  and differential field laws. Often the same problem is solved by different methods
  so that the advantages and limitations of each approach becomes clear. Sample problems
  and their solutions are presented for each new concept with great emphasis placed
  on classical models of physical phenomena such as polarization, conduction, and
  magnetization. A large variety of related problems that reinforce the text material
  are included at the end of each chapter for exercise and homework.
