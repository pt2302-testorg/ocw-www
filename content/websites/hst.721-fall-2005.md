course_description: 'In this course, experimental approaches to the study of hearing
  and deafness are presented through lectures, laboratory exercises and discussions
  of the primary literature on the auditory periphery. Topics include inner-ear development,
  functional anatomy of the inner ear, cochlear mechanics and micromechanics, mechano-electric
  transduction by hair cells, outer hair cells'' electromotility and the cochlear
  amplifier, otoacoustic emissions, synaptic transmission, stimulus coding in auditory
  nerve responses, efferent control of cochlear function, damage and repair of hair-cell
  organs, and sensorineural hearing loss.
