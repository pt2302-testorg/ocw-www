course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to bargaining and negotiation
  in public, business, and legal settings. It combines a "hands-on" skill-building
  orientation with a look at pertinent social theory. Strategy, communications, ethics,
  and institutional influences are examined as they influence the ability of actors
  to analyze problems, negotiate agreements, and resolve disputes in social, organizational,
  and political circumstances characterized by interdependent interests.
