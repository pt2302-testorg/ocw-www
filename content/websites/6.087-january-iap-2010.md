course_description: 'This course provides a thorough introduction to the C programming
  language, the workhorse of the UNIX operating system and lingua franca of embedded
  processors and micro-controllers. The first two weeks will cover basic syntax and
  grammar, and expose students to practical programming techniques. The remaining
  lectures will focus on more advanced concepts, such as dynamic memory allocation,
  concurrency and synchronization, UNIX signals and process control, library development
  and usage. Daily programming assignments and weekly laboratory exercises are required.
  Knowledge of C is highly marketable for summer internships, UROPs, and full-time
  positions in software and embedded systems development.
