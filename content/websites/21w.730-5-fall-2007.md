course_description: "Turn-of-the-century eras have historically been times when people\
  \ are more than usually inclined to scrutinize the present and speculate about the\
  \ future. Now, the turn not just of a century but of a millennium having recently\
  \ passed, such scrutiny and speculations inevitably intensify. What will the future\
  \ that awaits us in this twenty-first century and beyond be like? And how do visions\
  \ of that future reflect and respond to the world we live in now? In this course\
  \ we will read and write about how some writers and filmmakers have responded to\
  \ the present as a way of imagining\u2014and warning about\u2014possible worlds\
  \ to come. Guided by our reading and discussion, we will scrutinize our own present\
  \ and construct our own visions of the future through close readings of the texts\
  \ as well as of some aspects of contemporary culture\u2014urban and environmental\
  \ crises, economic imperialism, sexual and reproductive politics, the ethics of\
  \ biotechnologies, issues of race and gender, the romance of technology, robotics\
  \ and cyborg cultures, media saturation, language and representation\u2014and the\
  \ persistent questions they pose about what it means to be human at this start of\
  \ a new millennium.\n"
