course_description: 'During this course, we will study the similarities between cancer
  and normal development to understand how tumors co-opt normal developmental processes
  to facilitate cancer initiation, maintenance and progression. We will examine critical
  signaling pathways that govern these processes and, importantly, how some of these
  pathways hold promise as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. We will discuss
  how future treatments might be personalized to target cancer cells in specific patients.
  We will also consider examples of newly-approved drugs that have dramatically helped
  patients combat this devastating disease.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
