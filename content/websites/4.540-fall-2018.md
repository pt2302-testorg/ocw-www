course_description: Shape grammars are systems of visual rules by which one shape
  may be transformed into another. By applying these rules recursively, a simple shape
  can be elaborated into a complex pattern. This course offers an in-depth introduction
  to shape grammars and their applications in architecture and related areas of design.
  More specifically, it involves manipulation of shapes in the algebras Uij, in the
  algebras Vij and Wij incorporating labels and weights, and in algebras formed as
  composites of these. Discussions center on rules and computations, shape and structure,
  and designs.
