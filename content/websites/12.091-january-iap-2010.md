course_description: 'This course covers the following questions. What are the predominant
  heat producing elements of the Earth? Where and how much are they? Are they present
  in the core of the Earth? Detection of antineutrinos generated in the Earth provides:
  1) information on the sources of the terrestrial heat, 2) direct test of the Bulk
  Silicate Earth (BSE) model and 3) testing of non-conventional models of Earth''s
  core. Use of antineutrinos to probe the deep interior of our planet is becoming
  practical due to recent fundamental advances in the antineutrino detectors.
