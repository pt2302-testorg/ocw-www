course_description: 'This course introduces scholarly debates about the sociocultural
  practices through which individuals and societies create, sustain, recall, and erase
  memories. Emphasis is given to the history of knowledge, construction of memory,
  the role of authorities in shaping memory, and how societies decide on whose versions
  of memory are more "truthful" and "real." Other topics include how memory works
  in the human brain, memory and trauma, amnesia, memory practices in the sciences,
  false memory, sites of memory, and the commodification of memory. Students taking
  the graduate version complete additional assignments.
