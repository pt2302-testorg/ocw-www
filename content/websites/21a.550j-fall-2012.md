course_description: 'This course is an introductory exploration of documentary film
  theory and production, focusing on documentaries about science, engineering, and
  related fields. Students engage in digital video production as well as social and
  media analysis of science documentaries. Readings are drawn from social studies
  of science as well as from documentary film theory. The courses uses documentary
  video making as a tool to explore the worlds of science and engineering, as well
  as a tool for thinking analytically about media itself and the social worlds in
  which science is embedded. The course includes a hands-on lab component devoted
  to digital video production, in addition to classroom lectures and in-class film
  screenings.
