course_description: 'This subject serves as a broad introduction to the field of European
  and Latin American fiction. It is designed to help students acquire a general understanding
  of major fictional modes. We will pay attention not only to the literary movements
  these works represent, but also to the subtle interplay of history, geography, language
  and cultural norms that gave rise to specific literary forms. The books we read
  in this course are compelling, and film versions of five of the works we read give
  variety to the course and time to think about the interplay of film and print.
