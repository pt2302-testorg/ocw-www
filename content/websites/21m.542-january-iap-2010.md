course_description: 'This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of three broad
  topics concerning music in relation to time.


  1.  Music as Architecture: the creation of musical shapes in time;

  2.  Music as Memory: how musical understanding depends upon memory and reminiscence,
  with attention to analysis of musical structures; and

  3.  Time as the Substance of Music: how different disciplines such as philosophy
  and neuroscience view the temporal dimension of musical processes and/or performances.


  Classroom discussion of these topics is complemented by three weekend concerts with
  pre-concert forums, jointly presented by the [Boston Chamber Music Society](http://www.bostonchambermusic.org/)
  (BCMS) and MIT Music & Theater Arts.
