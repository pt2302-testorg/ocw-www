course_description: 'This class investigates the use of computers in architectural
  design and construction. It begins with a pre-prepared design computer model, which
  is used for testing and process investigation in construction. It then explores
  the process of construction from all sides of the practice: detail design, structural
  design, and both legal and computational issues.
