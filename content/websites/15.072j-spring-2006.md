course_description: 'This class deals with the modeling and analysis of queueing systems,
  with applications in communications, manufacturing, computers, call centers, service
  industries and transportation. Topics include birth-death processes and simple Markovian
  queues, networks of queues and product form networks, single and multi-server queues,
  multi-class queueing networks, fluid models, adversarial queueing networks, heavy-traffic
  theory and diffusion approximations. The course will cover state of the art results
  which lead to research opportunities.
