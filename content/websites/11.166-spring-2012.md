course_description: 'This course studies the interaction between law, courts, and
  social movements in shaping domestic and global public policy. Examines how groups
  mobilize to use law to affect change and why they succeed and fail. The class uses
  case studies to explore the interplay between law, social movements, and public
  policy in current areas such as gender, race, labor, trade, environment, and human
  rights. Finally, it introduces the theories of public policy, social movements,
  law and society, and transnational studies.
