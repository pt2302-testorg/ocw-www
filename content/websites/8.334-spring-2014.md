course_description: 'This is the second term in a two-semester course on statistical
  mechanics. Basic principles are examined in this class, such as the laws of thermodynamics
  and the concepts of temperature, work, heat, and entropy. Topics from modern statistical
  mechanics are also explored, including the hydrodynamic limit and classical field
  theories.
