course_description: '[_8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves_](/courses/8-03sc-physics-iii-vibrations-and-waves-fall-2016/)
  is the third course in the core physics curriculum at MIT, following _8.01 Physics
  I: Classical Mechanics_ and _8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism_. Topics
  include mechanical vibrations and waves, electromagnetic waves, and optics. These
  Problem Solving Help Videos provide step-by-step solutions to sample problems. Also
  included is information about how Physics III is typically taught on the MIT campus.
  [Instructor Insights](/resources/res-8-005-vibrations-and-waves-problem-solving-fall-2012/instructor-insights/)
  are shared by Professor Wit Busza who has taught Physics III and its associated
  recitation sessions many times. Professor Busza''s insights focus on his approach
  to problem solving, strategies for supporting students as they solve problems, and
  common sources of confusion for students in the process of problem solving.


  **Note**: These videos were originally produced as part of a physics course that
  is no longer available on OCW.
