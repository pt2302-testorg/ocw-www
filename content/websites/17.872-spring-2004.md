course_description: 'This course provides students with a rigorous introduction to
  Statistics for Political Science. Topics include basic mathematical tools used in
  social science modeling and statistics, probability theory, theory of estimation
  and inference, and statistical methods, especially differences of means and regression.
  The course is often taken by students outside of political science, especially those
  in business, urban studies, and various fields of public policy, such as public
  health. Examples draw heavily from political science, but some problems come from
  other areas, such as labor economics.
