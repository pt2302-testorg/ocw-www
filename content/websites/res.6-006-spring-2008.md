course_description: 'This resource contains demonstrations used to illustrate the
  theory and applications of lasers and optics. A detailed listing of the topics can
  be found below.


  Lasers today are being used in an ever-increasing number of applications. In fact,
  there is hardly a field that has not been touched by the laser. Lasers are playing
  key roles in the home, office, hospital, factory, outdoors, and theater, as well
  as in the laboratory.


  To learn about lasers and related optics, one usually takes a course or two, or
  acquires the necessary information from books and journal articles. To make this
  learning more vivid and more exciting, and, one hopes, more understandable, one
  needs to see some of the basic phenomena involved. To fill this need, Professor
  Ezekiel has videotaped 48 demonstrations that illustrate most of the fundamental
  phenomena relating to lasers and physical optics.


  By using split-screen inserts and a wide range of video-recording capabilities,
  it is possible to show real-time effects in lasers and optics with the simultaneous
  manipulation of the components that cause these effects. In this way, one can see
  effects in close up that would be difficult, if not impossible, to display in front
  of an audience or in the classroom.


  These video demonstrations are designed for:


  *   The individual student of lasers and optics who wants to observe the various
  phenomena covered in theoretical treatments in courses, books, and technical papers.

  *   The Instructor in lasers and optics in a company, university, college, or high
  school who wants to illustrate, in class, many of the fundamental phenomena in optics
  and lasers.


  These videos were produced by the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Study.
