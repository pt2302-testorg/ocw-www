course_description: 'This course studies basic optimization and the principles of
  optimal control. It considers deterministic and stochastic problems for both discrete
  and continuous systems. The course covers solution methods including numerical search
  algorithms, model predictive control, dynamic programming, variational calculus,
  and approaches based on Pontryagin''s maximum principle, and it includes many examples
  and applications of the theory.
