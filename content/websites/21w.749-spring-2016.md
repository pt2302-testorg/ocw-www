course_description: "In this course, you will be exposed to the work of many great\
  \ documentary photographers and photojournalists, as well as to writing about the\
  \ documentary tradition. Further, throughout the term, you will hone your photographic\
  \ skills and 'eye,' and you will work on a photo documentary project of your own,\
  \ attempting to reduce a tiny area of the moving world to a set of still images\
  \ that convey what the viewer needs to know about what you saw\u2014without hearing\
  \ the sounds, smelling the odors, experiencing what was happening outside the viewfinder,\
  \ and without seeing the motion.\n"
