course_description: "This International Study Tour went to New Zealand during the\
  \ first half of the 2016 Spring semester and travel during the Sloan Innovation\
  \ Period. International Study Tours provide students with a course credit opportunity\
  \ to identify and address issues about which they feel particularly passionate.\
  \ After classroom sessions featuring faculty, industry, and cultural experts, students\
  \ embark on site visits to their destination of choice, meeting with industry and\
  \ government leaders, as well as local alumni. Through these visits, students are\
  \ able to build on the preparatory course work with an in-depth exploration of industries,\
  \ companies, and countries they have visited.\n\nThis course fulfills the Sloan\
  \ Innovation Period (SIP) elective requirement. SIP\_occurs at the midpoint of each\
  \ semester providing students with an intensive week of experiential leadership\
  \ learning, as well as exposure to groundbreaking faculty work. It allows students\
  \ to engage in intellectual exploration outside the classroom. SIP degree requirements\
  \ include core courses in ethics and leadership as well as electives.\n"
