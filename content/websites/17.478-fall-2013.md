course_description: 'This course examines systematically, and comparatively, great
  and middle power military interventions, and candidate military interventions, into
  civil wars from the 1990s to the present. These civil wars did not easily fit into
  the traditional category of vital interest. These interventions may therefore tell
  us something about broad trends in international politics including the nature of
  unipolarity, the erosion of sovereignty, the security implications of globalization,
  and the nature of modern western military power.
