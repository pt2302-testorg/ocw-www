course_description: 'This graduate class is designed as a Ph.D.-level overview of
  international political economy (IPE), with an emphasis on the advanced industrial
  countries. It also serves as preparation for the IPE portion of the International
  Relations general exam. An important goal of the course is to use economic theories
  to identify the welfare effects, distributional consequences, and security implication
  of foreign economic policy decisions, and to use the tools of political science
  to analyze how interest groups, voters, political parties, electoral institutions,
  ideas, and power politics interact to share policy outcomes.
