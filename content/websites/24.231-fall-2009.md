course_description: 'This will be a seminar on classic and contemporary work on central
  topics in ethics. The first third of the course will focus on **metaethics**: we
  will examine the meaning of moral claims and ask whether there is any sense in which
  moral principles are objectively valid. The second third of the course will focus
  on **normative ethics**: what makes our lives worth living, what makes our actions
  right or wrong, and what do we owe to others? The final third of the course will
  focus on **moral character**: what is virtue, and how important is it? Can we be
  held responsible for what we do? When and why?
