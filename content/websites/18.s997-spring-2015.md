course_description: 'This course offers an introduction to the finite sample analysis
  of high- dimensional statistical methods. The goal is to present various proof techniques
  for state-of-the-art methods in regression, matrix estimation and principal component
  analysis (PCA) as well as optimality guarantees. The course ends with research questions
  that are currently open.
