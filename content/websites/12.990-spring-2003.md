course_description: 'Forecasting is the ultimate form of model validation. But even
  if a perfect model is in hand, imperfect forecasts are likely. This course will
  cover the factors that limit our ability to produce good forecasts, will show how
  the quality of forecasts can be gauged _a priori_ (predicting our ability to predict!),
  and will cover the state of the art in operational atmosphere and ocean forecasting
  systems.
