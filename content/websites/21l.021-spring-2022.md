course_description: "Comedy, that most elastic literary and performance mode, skewers\
  \ artifice, topples authority, and reverses expectations, not with the fatal outcomes\
  \ of tragedy but with laughter and festivity. This class examines both deep roots\
  \ and current forms of comedy, with a particular focus on comic insubordination.\
  \ And food.\n\nWe will revel in Greek, Roman, and Shakespearean drama; explore Aphra\
  \ Behn\u2019s eighteenth-century feminist rakes and sexual adventurers in *The Rover*;\
  \ investigate social satire in Jane Austen, Herman Melville, and Oscar Wilde; peek\
  \ under the covers of small-town family life in Alison Bechdel\u2019s *Fun Home*;\
  \ and probe the uneasy relationship between farce and romantic love, violence and\
  \ redemptive humor, satire and festivity in comic art. Discussion will draw on examples\
  \ of popular and contemporary forms, including film and sketch comedy."
