course_description: 'Increasingly, we are realizing that to make computer systems
  more intelligent and responsive to users, we will have to make them more sensitive
  to context. Traditional hardware and software design overlooks context because it
  conceptualizes systems as input-output functions. Systems take input explicitly
  given to them by a human, act upon that input alone and produce explicit output.
  But this view is too restrictive. Smart computers, intelligent agent software, and
  digital devices of the future will also have to operate on data that they observe
  or gather for themselves. They may have to sense their environment, decide which
  aspects of a situation are really important, and infer the user''s intention from
  concrete actions. The system''s actions may be dependent on time, place, or the
  history of interaction, in other words, dependent upon context.


  But what exactly is context? We''ll look at perspectives from machine learning,
  sensors and embedded devices, information visualization, philosophy and psychology.
  We''ll see how each treats the problem of context, and discuss the implications
  for design of context-sensitive hardware and software.


  Course requirements will consist of critiques of class readings (about 3 papers/week),
  and a final project (paper or computer implementation project).
