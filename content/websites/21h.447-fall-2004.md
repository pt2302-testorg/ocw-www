course_description: 'The rise and fall of National Socialism is one of the most intensively-studied
  topics in European history. Nevertheless, after more than half a century, popular
  views of Nazism in the media and among the public remain simplistic-essentialized
  by equal parts fascination and horror. Adolf Hitler, for instance, is often portrayed
  as an evil genius of supernatural ability; while the Nazi state is similarly imagined
  to have held absolute power over every aspect of its subjects'' lives. Such characterizations
  allow ordinary Germans to be portrayed as helpless victims of Nazism, ensnared or
  coerced into submission by forces beyond their control. Another popular characterization
  is that German culture itself is fundamentally flawed - that all Germans were basically
  Nazis at heart. This schema conveniently erases the manifestations of fascism in
  other Western nations, and allows Americans and other Westerners to reassure themselves
  that the horrors of Nazism could never emerge in their own enlightened national
  cultures.
