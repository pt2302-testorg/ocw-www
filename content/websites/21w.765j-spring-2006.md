course_description: 'This course covers techniques of creating narratives that take
  advantage of the flexibility of form offered by the computer. The course studies
  the structural properties of book-based narratives that experiment with digression,
  multiple points of view, disruptions of time and of storyline. The class analyzes
  the structure and evaluates the literary qualities of computer-based narratives
  including hypertexts, adventure games, and classic artificial intelligence programs
  like Eliza. With this base, students use authoring systems to model a variety of
  narrative techniques and to create their own fictions. Knowledge of programming
  is helpful but not necessary.
