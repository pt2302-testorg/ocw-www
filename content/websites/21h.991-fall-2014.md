course_description: 'This subject examines some of the many ways that contemporary
  historians interpret the past, as well as the multiple types of sources on which
  they rely for evidence. It is by no means an exhaustive survey, but the topics and
  readings have been chosen to give a sense of the diversity of work that is encompassed
  in the discipline of history.
