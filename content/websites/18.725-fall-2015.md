course_description: 'This is the first semester of a two-semester sequence on Algebraic
  Geometry. The goal of the course is to introduce the basic notions and techniques
  of modern algebraic geometry. It covers fundamental notions and results about algebraic
  varieties over an algebraically closed field; relations between complex algebraic
  varieties and complex analytic varieties; and examples with emphasis on algebraic
  curves and surfaces. This course is an introduction to the language of schemes and
  properties of morphisms.
