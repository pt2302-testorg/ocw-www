course_description: 'This course covers the analytical, graphical, and numerical methods
  supporting the analysis and design of integrated biological systems. Topics include
  modularity and abstraction in biological systems, mathematical encoding of detailed
  physical problems, numerical methods for solving the dynamics of continuous and
  discrete chemical systems, statistics and probability in dynamic systems, applied
  local and global optimization, simple feedback and control analysis, statistics
  and probability in pattern recognition.
