course_description: 'This course addresses the scientific basis for the development
  of new drugs. The first half of the semester begins with an overview of the drug
  discovery process, followed by fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
  metabolism, and the mechanisms by which drugs cause therapeutic and toxic responses.
  The second half of the semester applies those principles to case studies and literature
  discussions of current problems with specific drugs, drug classes, and therapeutic
  targets.
