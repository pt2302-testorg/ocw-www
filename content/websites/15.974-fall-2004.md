course_description: 'Practical Leadership is an interactive seminar where students
  receive repeated coaching and real-time feedback on their own leadership capabilities
  from their peers and the instructor. The course is structured around a set of readings.
  However, the key component is each student''s own self-assessment. These self-assessments
  are done by the students in the first week of the semester. The areas for improvement
  that the students identify are then targeted in the weekly role plays that are customized
  for each student in the class. The goal of the class is for each student to increase
  his or her own leadership abilities through an ongoing cycle of practice, feedback
  and reflection.
