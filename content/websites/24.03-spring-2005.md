course_description: 'Are moral standards relative to cultures and/or moral frameworks?
  Are there incompatible or non-comparable ways of thinking about the world that are
  somehow equally good? Is science getting closer to the truth? Is rationality--the
  notion of a good reason to believe something--relative to cultural norms? What are
  selves? Is there a coherent form of relativism about the self? Guided by the writings
  of Thomas Kuhn, Gilbert Harman, Judith Thomson, John Perry and Derek Parfit, we
  attempt to make these vague questions precise, and we make a start at answering
  them.
