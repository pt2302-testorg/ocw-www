course_description: 'Advances in cognitive science have resolved, clarified, and sometimes
  complicated some of the great questions of Western philosophy: what is the structure
  of the world and how do we come to know it; does everyone represent the world the
  same way; what is the best way for us to act in the world. Specific topics include
  color, objects, number, categories, similarity, inductive inference, space, time,
  causality, reasoning, decision-making, morality and consciousness. Readings and
  discussion include a brief philosophical history of each topic and focus on advances
  in cognitive and developmental psychology, computation, neuroscience, and related
  fields. At least one subject in cognitive science, psychology, philosophy, linguistics,
  or artificial intelligence is required. An additional project is required for graduate
  credit.
