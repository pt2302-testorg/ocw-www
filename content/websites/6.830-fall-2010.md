course_description: This course relies on primary readings from the database community
  to introduce graduate students to the foundations of database systems, focusing
  on basics such as the relational algebra and data model, schema normalization, query
  optimization, and transactions. It is designed for students who have taken [6.033](/courses/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/)
  (or equivalent); no prior database experience is assumed, though students who have
  taken an undergraduate course in databases are encouraged to attend.
