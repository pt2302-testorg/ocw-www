course_description: 'Problems in nuclear engineering often involve applying knowledge
  from many disciplines simultaneously in achieving satisfactory solutions. The course
  will focus on understanding the complete nuclear reactor system including the balance
  of plant, support systems and resulting interdependencies affecting the overall
  safety of the plant and regulatory oversight. Both the Seabrook and Pilgrim nuclear
  plant simulators will be used as part of the educational experience to provide as
  realistic as possible understanding of nuclear power systems short of being at the
  reactor.
