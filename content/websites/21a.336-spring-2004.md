course_description: 'Everyday we are bombarded with the word "global" and encouraged
  to see globalization as the quintessential transformation of our age. But what exactly
  does "globalization" mean? How is it affecting the lives of people around the world,
  not only in economic, but social and cultural terms? How do contemporary changes
  compare with those from other historical periods? Are such changes positive, negative
  or simply inevitable? And, finally, how does the concept of the "global" itself
  shape our perceptions in ways that both help us understand the contemporary world
  and potentially distort it? This course begins by offering a brief overview of historical
  "world systems," including those centered in Asia as well as Europe. It explores
  the nature of contemporary transformations, including those in economics, media
  & information technologies, population flows, and consumer habits, not through abstractions
  but by focusing on the daily lives of people in various parts of the world. This
  course considers such topics as the day-to-day impact of computers in Silicon Valley
  and among Tibetan refugees; the dilemmas of factory workers in the US and rural
  Java; the attractions of Bombay cinema in Nigeria, the making of rap music in Japan,
  and the cultural complexities of immigrant life in France. This course seeks not
  only to understand the various forms globalization takes, but to understand its
  very different impacts world-wide.
