course_description: 'During the last fifteen years, nations across the globe embarked
  on a historic transformation away from centrally planned economies to market-oriented
  ones. However, in the common pursuit for economic growth, these transition countries
  implemented widely different reform strategies with mixed results. With over a decade
  of empirical evidence now available, this new course examines this phenomenon that
  has pushed the discourse in a number of disciplines, requiring us to reconsider
  fundamental issues such as:


  *   the proper relationship between business, government, and the public interest

  *   the possible synergies and tensions between economic growth and equity

  *   how economic transition has reshaped cities


  The premise of the course is that the core issue in transition involves institution-building
  and re-building in different contexts.
