course_description: 'The "Renaissance" as a phenomenon in European history is best
  understood as a series of social, political, and cultural responses to an intellectual
  trend which began in Italy in the fourteenth century. This intellectual tendency,
  known as humanism, or the _studia humanitatis_, was at the heart of developments
  in literature, the arts, the sciences, religion, and government for almost three
  hundred years. In this class, we will highlight the history of humanism, but we
  will also study religious reformations, high politics, the agrarian world, and European
  conquest and expansion abroad in the period.
