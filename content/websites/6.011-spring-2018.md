course_description: 'This course covers signals, systems and inference in communication,
  control and signal processing. Topics include input-output and state-space models
  of linear systems driven by deterministic and random signals; time- and transform-domain
  representations in discrete and continuous time; and group delay. State feedback
  and observers. Probabilistic models; stochastic processes, correlation functions,
  power spectra, spectral factorization. Least-mean square error estimation; Wiener
  filtering. Hypothesis testing; detection; matched filters.
