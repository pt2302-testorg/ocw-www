course_description: "This course expands skills in speaking, reading, listening, and\
  \ writing. Students develop analytic and interpretative skills through the reading\
  \ of a full-length drama as well as short prose and poetry (Biermann, Brecht, D\xFC\
  rrenmatt, Tawada and others) and through media selections on contemporary issues\
  \ in German-speaking cultures. Coursework includes discussions and compositions\
  \ based on these texts, and review of grammar and development of vocabulary-building\
  \ strategies. It is recommended for students with two years of high school German.\n"
