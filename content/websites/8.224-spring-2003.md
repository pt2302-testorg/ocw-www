course_description: 'Study of physical effects in the vicinity of a black hole as
  a basis for understanding general relativity, astrophysics, and elements of cosmology.
  Extension to current developments in theory and observation. Energy and momentum
  in flat spacetime; the metric; curvature of spacetime near rotating and nonrotating
  centers of attraction; trajectories and orbits of particles and light; elementary
  models of the Cosmos. Weekly meetings include an evening seminar and recitation.
  The last third of the semester is reserved for collaborative research projects on
  topics such as the Global Positioning System, solar system tests of relativity,
  descending into a black hole, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, Gravity
  Probe B, and more advanced models of the Cosmos.
