course_description: "The Team Project has the goals of (1) developing teamwork and\
  \ leadership skills and (2) learning from the analysis of a change initiative in\
  \ a real-world company using concepts from other core courses. This class has no\
  \ regular class schedule or weekly readings. Almost everything is oriented around\
  \ your team and your project, with only a few deadlines.\_Each team is responsible\
  \ for analyzing a recent, ongoing, or anticipated initiative at a real company.\
  \ Examples might be a strategic reorientation, organizational restructuring, introduction\
  \ of a new technology, or worker participation program.\n\nThis course is closely\
  \ integrated with other MBA core classes: readings are assigned through Organizational\
  \ Processes (15.311) and oral presentations are given in Communication for Managers\
  \ (15.280).\n"
