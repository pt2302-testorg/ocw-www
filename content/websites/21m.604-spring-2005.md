  weekly assignments, in class writing exercises, and work on a sustained piece, students
  explore scene structure, action, events, voice, and dialogue. We examine produced
  playscripts and discuss student work. This class''s emphasis is on process, risk-taking,
  and finding one''s own voice and vision.
