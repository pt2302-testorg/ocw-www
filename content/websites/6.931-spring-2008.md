course_description: 'This course examines the role of the engineer as patent expert
  and as technical witness in court and patent interference and related proceedings.
  It discusses the rights and obligations of engineers in connection with educational
  institutions, government, and large and small businesses. It compares various manners
  of transplanting inventions into business operations, including development of New
  England and other U.S. electronics and biotechnology industries and their different
  types of institutions. The course also considers American systems of incentive to
  creativity apart from the patent laws in the atomic energy and space fields.
