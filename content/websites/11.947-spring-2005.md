course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the issues of immigrants,
  planning, and race. It identifies the complexities and identities of immigrant populations
  emerging in the United States context and how different community groups negotiate
  that complexity. It explores the critical differences and commonalities between
  immigrant and non-immigrant communities, as well as how the planning profession
  does and should respond to those differences. Finally, the course explores the intersection
  of immigrant communities'' formation and their interactions with African Americans
  and the idea of race in the United States.
