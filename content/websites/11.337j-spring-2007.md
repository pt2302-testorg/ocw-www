course_description: "Governments at every level assume a measure of responsibility\
  \ for seeking good design. Some of that responsibility is exercised directly\u2014\
  through the design and construction of government buildings, for example. But most\
  \ changes to our environments are neither designed nor built by governments. Rather,\
  \ they are the result of the actions and investments of private individuals, institutions,\
  \ corporations, joint ventures, or private/public collaborations. Yet, the actions\
  \ of all of these actors are affected by the design policies of government and the\
  \ interventions that are undertaken to implement those policies. In this advanced\
  \ graduate-level seminar we will explore new ways of thinking about urban design\
  \ policy in an attempt to better understand just what government does\u2014and what\
  \ it can do effectively\u2014in the realm of design policy.\n"
