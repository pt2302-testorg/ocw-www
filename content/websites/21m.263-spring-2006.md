course_description: 'This course begins with the premise that the 1960s mark a great
  dividing point in the history of 20th century Western musical culture, and explores
  the ways in which various social and artistic concerns of composers, performers,
  and listeners have evolved since that decade. It focuses on works by classical composers
  from around the world. Topics include the impact of rock, as it developed during
  the 1960s - 70s; the concurrent emergence of post serial, neotonal, minimalist,
  and new age styles; the globalization of Western musical traditions; the impact
  of new technologies; and the significance of music video, video games, and other
  versions of multimedia. The course interweaves discussion of these topics with close
  study of seminal musical works, evenly distributed across the four decades since
  1960; works by MIT composers are included.
