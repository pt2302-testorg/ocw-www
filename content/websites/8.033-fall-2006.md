course_description: 'This course, which concentrates on special relativity, is normally
  taken by physics majors in their sophomore year. Topics include Einstein''s postulates,
  the Lorentz transformation, relativistic effects and paradoxes, and applications
  involving electromagnetism and particle physics. This course also provides a brief
  introduction to some concepts of general relativity, including the principle of
  equivalence, the Schwartzschild metric and black holes, and the FRW metric and cosmology.
