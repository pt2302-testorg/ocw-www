course_description: 'Bacteria survive in almost all environments on Earth, including
  some considered extremely harsh. From the steaming hot springs of Yellowstone to
  the frozen tundra of the arctic to the barren deserts of Chile, microbes have been
  found thriving. Their tenacity to survive in such extreme and varied conditions
  allows them to play fundamental roles in global nutrient cycling. Microbes also
  cause a wide range of human diseases and can survive inhospitable conditions found
  in the human body. In this course, we will examine the molecular systems that bacteria
  use to adapt to changes in their environment. We will consider stresses commonly
  encountered, such as starvation, oxidative stress and heat shock, and also discuss
  how the adaptive responses affect the evolution of the bacteria.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
