course_description: 'Geographic Information System (GIS) software manages data that
  represent the location of features (geographic coordinate data) and what they are
  like (attribute data); it also provides the ability to query, manipulate, and analyze
  those data. Because GIS allows one to represent social and environmental data on
  maps, it is a powerful tool for analysis and planning in various fields. This course
  is meant to introduce students to the basic capabilities of GIS.
