course_description: 'This course offers an advanced introduction to numerical analysis,
  with a focus on accuracy and efficiency of numerical algorithms. Topics include
  sparse-matrix/iterative and dense-matrix algorithms in numerical linear algebra
  (for linear systems and eigenproblems), floating-point arithmetic, backwards error
  analysis, conditioning, and stability. Other computational topics (e.g., numerical
  integration or nonlinear optimization) are also surveyed.
