course_description: "This is the first course in the undergraduate Quantum Physics\
  \ sequence. It introduces the basic features of quantum mechanics. It covers the\
  \ experimental basis of quantum physics, introduces wave mechanics, Schr\xF6dinger's\
  \ equation in a single dimension, and Schr\xF6dinger's equation in three dimensions.\
  \ The lectures and lecture notes for this course form the basis of Zwiebach\u2019\
  s textbook *Mastering Quantum Mechanics* published by\_[MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mastering-quantum-mechanics)\_\
  in April 2022.\n\nThis presentation of 8.04 by Barton Zwiebach (2016) differs somewhat\
  \ and complements nicely the presentation of [Allan Adams (2013)](/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013/).\
  \ Adams covers a larger set of ideas; Zwiebach tends to go deeper into a smaller\
  \ set of ideas, offering a systematic and detailed treatment. Adams begins with\
  \ the subtleties of superpostion, while Zwiebach discusses the surprises of interaction-free\
  \ measurements. While both courses overlap over a sizable amount of standard material,\
  \ Adams discussed applications to condensed matter physics, while Zwiebach focused\
  \ on scattering and resonances. The different perspectives of the instructors make\
  \ the problem sets in the two courses rather different."
