course_description: "This course is a three-part series which explains the basis of\
  \ the electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of materials including semiconductors,\
  \ metals, organics, and insulators. We will show how devices are built to take advantage\
  \ of these properties. This is illustrated with a wide range of devices, placing\
  \ a strong emphasis on new and emerging technologies.\n\nThe first part of the course\
  \ covers electronic materials and devices, including diodes, bipolar junction transistors,\
  \ MOSFETs, and semiconductor properties. The second part covers optical materials\
  \ and devices, including photodetectors, solar cells (photovoltaics), displays,\
  \ light emitting diodes, lasers, optical fibers, optical communications, and photonic\
  \ devices. The final part of the series covers magnetic materials and devices, including\
  \ magnetic data storage, motors, transformers, and spintronics.\n\nThis course was\
  \ organized as a three-part series on [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx)\_\
  by MIT\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering and\_is now archived\
  \ on the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), which is free to\
  \ use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each modules if you want to\
  \ track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.\n"
