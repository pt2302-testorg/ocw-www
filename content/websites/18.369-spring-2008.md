course_description: "Find out what solid-state physics has brought to Electromagnetism\
  \ in the last 20 years. This course surveys the physics and mathematics of nanophotonics\u2014\
  electromagnetic waves in media structured on the scale of the wavelength.\n\nTopics\
  \ include computational methods combined with high-level algebraic techniques borrowed\
  \ from solid-state quantum mechanics: linear algebra and eigensystems, group theory,\
  \ Bloch's theorem and conservation laws, perturbation methods, and coupled-mode\
  \ theories, to understand surprising optical phenomena from band gaps to slow light\
  \ to nonlinear filters.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this course was published\
  \ on OCW as 18.325 Topics in Applied Mathematics: Mathematical Methods in Nanophotonics,\
  \ Fall 2005.\n"
