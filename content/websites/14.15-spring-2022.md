course_description: "Networks are ubiquitous in our modern society. The World Wide\
  \ Web that links us to the rest of the world is the most visible example. But it\
  \ is only one of many networks in which we are situated. Our social life is organized\
  \ around networks of friends and colleagues. These networks determine our information,\
  \ influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us,\
  \ often through weak but important ties, to everybody else in the United States\
  \ and in the world.\_\n\nThis course will introduce the tools for the study of networks.\
  \ It will show how certain common principles permeate the functioning of these diverse\
  \ networks and how the same issues related to robustness, fragility, and interlinkages\
  \ arise in many different types of networks."
