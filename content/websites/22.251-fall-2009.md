course_description: 'This course provides an in-depth technical and policy analysis
  of various options for the nuclear fuel cycle. Topics include uranium supply, enrichment
  fuel fabrication, in-core physics and fuel management of uranium, thorium and other
  fuel types, reprocessing and waste disposal. Also covered are the principles of
  fuel cycle economics and the applied reactor physics of both contemporary and proposed
  thermal and fast reactors. Nonproliferation aspects, disposal of excess weapons
  plutonium, and transmutation of actinides and selected fission products in spent
  fuel are examined. Several state-of-the-art computer programs are provided for student
  use in problem sets and term papers.
