course_description: 'This course examines the birth and international expansion of
  an American industry of political marketing. It focuses attention on the cultural
  processes, sociopolitical contexts and moral utopias that shape the practice of
  political marketing in the U.S. and in different countries. By looking at the debates
  and expert practices at the core of the business of politics, the course explores
  how the "universal" concept of democracy is interpreted and reworked through space
  and time, while examining how different cultural groups experimenting with political
  marketing understand the role of citizens in a democracy.
