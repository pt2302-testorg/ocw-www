course_description: 'This subject examines the paradoxes of contemporary globalization.
  Through lectures, discussions and student presentations, we will study the cultural,
  linguistic, social and political impact of globalization across broad international
  borders.


  We will pay attention to the subtle interplay of history, geography, language and
  cultural norms that gave rise to specific ways of life. The materials for the course
  include fiction, nonfiction, audio pieces, maps and visual materials.
