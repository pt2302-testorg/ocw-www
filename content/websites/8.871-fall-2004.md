course_description: 'This course is an introduction to branes in string theory and
  their world volume dynamics. Instead of looking at the theory from the point of
  view of the world-sheet observer, we will approach the problem from the point of
  view of an observer which lives on a brane. Instead of writing down conformal field
  theory on the world-sheet and studying the properties of these theories, we will
  look at various branes in string theory and ask how the physics on their world-volume
  looks like.
