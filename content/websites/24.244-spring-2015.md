course_description: 'Modal logic is the logic of necessity and possibility, and by
  extension of analogously paired notions like validity and consistency, obligation
  and permission, the known and the not-ruled-out. This a first course in the area.
  A solid background in first-order logic is essential. Topics to be covered include
  (some or all of) the main systems of propositional modal logic, Kripkean "possible
  world" semantics, strict implication, contingent identity, intensional objects,
  counterpart theory, the logic of actuality, and deontic and / or epistemic logic.
  The emphasis will be more on technical methods and results than philosophical applications.
