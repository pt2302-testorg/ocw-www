course_description: 'This course focuses on the origins, functions, and implications
  of downtown management organizations (DMOs), such as business improvement districts,
  in a variety of national contexts including the United States, Canada, South Africa,
  and the United Kingdom. It critically examines how a range of urban theories provide
  a rationale for the establishment and design of DMOs; the evolution and transnational
  transfer of DMO policy; and the spatial and political externalities associated with
  the local proliferation of DMOs. Particular emphasis is given to the role of DMOs
  in securing public space.
