course_description: 'In recent years, the redistribution of risk has created conditions
  for natural and technological disasters to become more widespread, more difficult
  to manage, and more discriminatory in their effects. Policy and planning decision-makers
  frequently focus on the impact that human settlement patterns, land use decisions,
  and risky technologies can have on vulnerable populations. However, to ensure safety
  and promote equity, they also must be familiar with the social and political dynamics
  that are present at each stage of the disaster management cycle. Therefore, this
  course will provide students with:


  1.  An understanding of the breadth of factors that give rise to disaster vulnerability;
  and

  2.  A foundation for assessing and managing the social and political processes associated
  with disaster policy and planning.
