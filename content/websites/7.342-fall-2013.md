course_description: 'Biomaterials are substances that have been designed to direct
  the course of any therapeutic or diagnostic procedure by controlling interactions
  with biological systems. A large toolbox of non-biological materials has been engineered
  to study cell behavior at the cell-material interface. In this course, we will examine
  how this interface can be leveraged to study cellular systems and generate novel
  therapeutics.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
