course_description: 'This course covers sediments in the rock cycle, production of
  sediments at the Earth''s surface, physics and chemistry of sedimentary materials,
  and scale and geometry of near-surface sedimentary bodies, including aquifers. We
  will also explore topics like sediment transport and deposition in modern sedimentary
  environments, burial and lithification, survey of major sedimentary rock types,
  stratigraphic relationships of sedimentary basins, and evolution of sedimentary
  processes through geologic time.
