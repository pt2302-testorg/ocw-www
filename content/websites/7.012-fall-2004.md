course_description: 'The MIT Biology Department core courses, 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014,
  all cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry,
  genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. Biological function at the molecular
  level is particularly emphasized and covers the structure and regulation of genes,
  as well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated
  into cells, and how these cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms.
  In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.


  7.012 focuses on the exploration of current research in cell biology, immunology,
  neurobiology, genomics, and molecular medicine.

  The study materials, problem sets, and quiz materials used during Fall 2004 for
  7.012 include contributions from past instructors, teaching assistants, and other
  members of the MIT Biology Department affiliated with course #7.012. Since the following
  works have evolved over a period of many years, no single source can be attributed.
