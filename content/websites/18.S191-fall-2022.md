course_description: "This class uses revolutionary programmable interactivity to combine\
  \ material from three fields -- Computer Science + Mathematics + Applications --\
  \ creating an engaging, efficient learning solution to prepare students to be sophisticated\
  \ and intuitive thinkers, programmers, and solution providers for the modern interconnected\
  \ online world.\n\nUpon completion, students are well trained to be scientific \u201C\
  trilinguals,\u201D seeing and experimenting with mathematics interactively as math\
  \ is meant to be seen, and ready to participate and contribute to open source development\
  \ of large projects and ecosystems."
