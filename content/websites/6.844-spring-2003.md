course_description: '6.844 is a graduate introduction to programming theory, logic
  of programming, and computability, with the programming language Scheme used to
  crystallize computability constructions and as an object of study itself. Topics
  covered include: programming and computability theory based on a term-rewriting,
  "substitution" model of computation by Scheme programs with side-effects; computation
  as algebraic manipulation: Scheme evaluation as algebraic manipulation and term
  rewriting theory; paradoxes from self-application and introduction to formal programming
  semantics; undecidability of the Halting Problem for Scheme; properties of recursively
  enumerable sets, leading to Incompleteness Theorems for Scheme equivalences; logic
  for program specification and verification; and Hilbert''s Tenth Problem.
