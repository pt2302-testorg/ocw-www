course_description: 'This course will guide graduate students through the process
  of using rapid prototyping and CAD/CAM devices in a studio environment. The class
  has a theoretical focus on machine use within the process of design. Each student
  is expected to have completed one graduate level of design computing with a full
  understanding of solid modeling in CAD. Students are also expected to have completed
  at least one graduate design studio.
