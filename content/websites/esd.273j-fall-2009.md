course_description: 'This course surveys operations research models and techniques
  developed for a variety of problems arising in logistical planning of multi-echelon
  systems. There is a focus on planning models for production/inventory/distribution
  strategies in general multi-echelon multi-item systems. Topics include vehicle routing
  problems, dynamic lot sizing inventory models, stochastic and deterministic multi-echelon
  inventory systems, the bullwhip effect, pricing models, and integration problems
  arising in supply chain management. Probability and linear programming experience
  required.
