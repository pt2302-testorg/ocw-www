  began a residency at the [MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology](https://arts.mit.edu/cast/)
  (CAST). He provided new perspectives on issues of access, privilege, and the global
  water crisis through a series of seminars, performances, and workshops. Carpenter''s
  seminars illustrated ways of disrupting systems of oppression and ways to increase
  access to potable water in politically marginalized communites in the United States
  and abroad.
