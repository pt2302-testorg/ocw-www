course_description: 'This course explores the importance of public transportation
  to social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to identify
  approaches to restoring transit ridership, with a focus on Metro Boston. We will
  attempt to (1) understand whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic can advance sustainable
  mobility, and specifically the role(s) of public transportation in the COVID-19
  recovery process, and (2) identify policies and/or interventions that may encourage
  pre-COVID transit riders to return to transit and attract net new transit ridership.
