course_description: 'City to City, as a class, will jump into the complexity of planning
  in New Orleans, a post-disaster city. City-to-City will ask how a post-disaster
  city grapple with its ideas of identity, what it is, who it represents, and how
  it projects its sense of self to residences, businesses, tourists, and to the outside
  world. In considering its people, how do city planners think about who lives where
  and why? At the same time, how can city planners celebrate a city''s history and
  its culture and how can these elements be woven into reconstruction? Students will
  travel from Cambridge to New Orleans over Spring Break to meet and consult with
  their alumni clients, and continue to work on projects.
