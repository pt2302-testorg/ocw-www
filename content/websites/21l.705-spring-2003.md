course_description: 'At this distance Oscar Wilde seems not only to be on the threshold
  between centuries and between cultural-systems: in many ways he seems to be the
  threshold. His aesthetics look backwards to the aestheticism of Pater and the moral
  sensibility of Ruskin, and they look forward to Modernism. His antecedents are 18th
  century playwrights, and he opened a path of irony and structural self-reflexivity
  that leads to Beckett and Tom Stoppard. He was Irish but achieved his great successes
  in England. Arguably, his greatest success was his greatest public failure: in his
  scandalous trials he shaped 20th century attitudes toward homosexuality and toward
  theatricality and toward performativity. His greatest performance was the role of
  "Oscar Wilde": in that sense he taught the 20th century how to be itself.
