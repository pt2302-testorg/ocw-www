course_description: 'This course explores contemporary American theatrical expression
  as it may be organized around issues of gender and cultural identity. This exploration
  will include the analysis of performances, scripts, and video documentation, as
  well as the invention of original documents of theatrical expression. Class lectures
  and discussions will analyze samples of Native American, Chicano, African American,
  and Asian American theater, taking into consideration the historical and political
  context for the creation of these works. Performance exercises will help students
  identify theatrical forms and techniques used by these theaters, and how these techniques
  contribute to the overall goals of specific theatrical expressions.
