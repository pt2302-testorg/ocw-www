course_description: 'This course explores the history of the ideal of personal freedom
  with an eye towards contemporary debates over the pros and cons of the regulatory
  state. The first part of the course surveys the sociological and theological sources
  of the concepts of freedom and civil society, and introduces liberty''s leading
  relatives or competitors: property, equality, community, and republicanism. The
  second part consists of a series of case studies in the rise of modern liberty and
  libertarianism: the abolition of slavery, the struggle for religious freedom, and
  the twentieth-century American civil liberties movement. In the last part of the
  course, we take up debates over the role of libertarianism vs. the regulatory state
  in a variety of contexts: counter-terrorism, health care, the financial markets,
  and the Internet.
