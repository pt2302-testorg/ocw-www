course_description: 'This course explores the ways in which humans experience the
  realm of sound and how perceptions and technologies of sound emerge from cultural,
  economic, and historical worlds. It examines how environmental, linguistic, and
  musical sounds are construed cross-culturally. It describes the rise of telephony,
  architectural acoustics, sound recording, and the globalized travel of these technologies.
  Students address questions of ownership, property, authorship, and copyright in
  the age of digital file sharing. There is a particular focus on how the sound/noise
  boundary is imagined, created and modeled across diverse sociocultural and scientific
  contexts. Auditory examples will be provided. Instruction and practice in written
  and oral communication provided. At MIT, this course is limited to 20 students.
