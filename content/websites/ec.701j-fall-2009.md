course_description: "D-Lab Development addresses issues of technological improvements\
  \ at the micro level for developing countries\u2014in particular, how the quality\
  \ of life of low-income households can be improved by adaptation of low cost and\
  \ sustainable technologies. Discussion of development issues as well as project\
  \ implementation challenges are addressed through lectures, case studies, guest\
  \ speakers and laboratory exercises. Students form project teams to partner with\
  \ mostly local level organizations in developing countries, and formulate plans\
  \ for an IAP site visit. (Previous field sites include Ghana, Brazil, Honduras and\
  \ India.) Project team meetings focus on developing specific projects and include\
  \ cultural, social, political, environmental and economic overviews of the countries\
  \ and localities to be visited as well as an introduction to the local languages.\n"
