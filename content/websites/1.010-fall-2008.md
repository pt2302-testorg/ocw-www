course_description: 'This course gives an introduction to probability and statistics,
  with emphasis on engineering applications. Course topics include events and their
  probability, the total probability and Bayes'' theorems, discrete and continuous
  random variables and vectors, uncertainty propagation and conditional analysis.
  Second-moment representation of uncertainty, random sampling, estimation of distribution
  parameters (method of moments, maximum likelihood, Bayesian estimation), and simple
  and multiple linear regression. Concepts illustrated with examples from various
  areas of engineering and everyday life.
