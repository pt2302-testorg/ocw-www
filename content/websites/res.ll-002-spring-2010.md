course_description: 'The 16 lectures in this course cover the topics of adaptive antennas
  and phased arrays. Both theory and experiments are covered in the lectures. Part
  one (lectures 1 to 7) covers adaptive antennas. Part two (lectures 8 to 16) covers
  phased arrays. Parts one and two can be studied independently (in either order).
  The intended audience for this course is primarily practicing engineers and students
  in electrical engineering. This course is presented by Dr. Alan J. Fenn, senior
  staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.
