course_description: 'This seminar provides intensive study of texts by two American
  authors (Herman Melville, 1819-1891, and Toni Morrison, 1931-) who, using lyrical,
  radically innovative prose, explore in different ways epic notions of American identity.
  Focusing on Melville''s _Typee_ (1846), _Moby-Dick_ (1851), and _The Confidence-Man_
  (1857) and Morrison''s _Sula_ (1973), _Beloved_ (1987), _Jazz_ (1992), and _Paradise_
  (1998), the class will address their common concerns with issues of gender, race,
  language, and nationhood. Be prepared to read deeply (i.e. a small number of texts
  with considerable care), to draw on a variety of sources in different media, and
  to employ them in creative research, writing, and multimedia projects.
