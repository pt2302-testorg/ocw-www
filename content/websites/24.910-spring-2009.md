course_description: 'This course explores topics related to the representation and
  expression of propositional attitudes (_e.g._ belief, knowledge, and desires) and
  speech acts (_e.g._ saying and asking) in natural language. The main focus will
  be on semantics of predicates such as **believe, know, want, say, ask**, etc. Other
  topics will include the syntax of main and embedded clauses and formal representation
  of the pragmatics of conversation. The course provides practice in written and oral
  communication.
