course_description: 'Information Technology I helps students understand technical
  concepts underlying current and future developments in information technology. There
  will be a special emphasis on networks and distributed computing. Students will
  also gain some hands-on exposure to powerful, high-level tools for making computers
  do amazing things, without the need for conventional programming languages. Since
  15.564 is an introductory course, no knowledge of how computers work or are programmed
  is assumed.
