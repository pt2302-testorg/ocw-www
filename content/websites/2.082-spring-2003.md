course_description: 'This course is intended for first year graduate students and
  advanced undergraduates with an interest in design of ships or offshore structures.
  It requires a sufficient background in structural mechanics. Computer applications
  are utilized, with emphasis on the theory underlying the analysis. Hydrostatic loading,
  shear load and bending moment, and resulting primary hull primary stresses will
  be developed. Topics will include; ship structural design concepts, effect of superstructures
  and dissimilar materials on primary strength, transverse shear stresses in the hull
  girder, and torsional strength among others. Failure mechanisms and design limit
  states will be developed for plate bending, column and panel buckling, panel ultimate
  strength, and plastic analysis. Matrix stiffness, grillage, and finite element analysis
  will be introduced. Design of a ship structure will be analyzed by "hand" with desktop
  computer tools and a final design project using current applications for structural
  design of a section will be accomplished.


  This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering)
  as 13.122. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department
  of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.082.
