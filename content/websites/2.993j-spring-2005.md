course_description: 'This course is offered to undergraduates and introduces students
  to the formulation, methodology, and techniques for numerical solution of engineering
  problems. Topics covered include: fundamental principles of digital computing and
  the implications for algorithm accuracy and stability, error propagation and stability,
  the solution of systems of linear equations, including direct and iterative techniques,
  roots of equations and systems of equations, numerical interpolation, differentiation
  and integration, fundamentals of finite-difference solutions to ordinary differential
  equations, and error and convergence analysis. The subject is taught the first half
  of the term.


  This subject was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering)
  as 13.002J. In 2005, ocean engineering became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical
  Engineering), and this subject was renumbered 2.993J.
