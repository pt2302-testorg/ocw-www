course_description: 'Wavelets are localized basis functions, good for representing
  short-time events. The coefficients at each scale are filtered and subsampled to
  give coefficients at the next scale. This is Mallat''s pyramid algorithm for multiresolution,
  connecting wavelets to filter banks. Wavelets and multiscale algorithms for compression
  and signal/image processing are developed. Subject is project-based for engineering
  and scientific applications.
