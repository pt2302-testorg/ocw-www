  gender discourse, the stereotyping of Asian American women and men in the media,
  Asian American masculinity, Asian American feminisms and their relation to mainstream
  American feminism, the debate between feminism and ethnic nationalism, gay and lesbian
  identity, class and labor issues, domestic violence, interracial dating and marriage,
  and multiracial identity.
