course_description: 'This is the second undergraduate architecture design studio,
  which introduces design logic and skills that enable design thinking, representation,
  and development. Through the lens of nano-scale machines, technologies, and phenomena,
  students are asked to explore techniques for describing form, space, and architecture.
  Exercises encourage various connotations of the "machine" and challenge students
  to translate conceptual strategies into more integrated design propositions through
  both digital and analog means.
