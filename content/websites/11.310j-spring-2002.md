course_description: "This workshop explores the potential of media technology and\
  \ the Internet to enhance communication and transform city design and community\
  \ development in inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods\
  \ for describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions\
  \ and changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple actors\
  \ in the process of envisioning change and guiding action. Students will engage\
  \ two neighborhoods: the Mill Creek neighborhood of West Philadelphia, PA, and the\
  \ Brightwood/Northend neighborhood of Springfield, MA.\_Students will meet real\
  \ people working on real projects, put theory into practice, and reflect on insights\
  \ gained in the process. Our hope is that student work will contribute to new initiatives\
  \ in both communities.\n\nThe class Web site can be found here:\_[Media Technology\
  \ and City Design and Development](http://web.mit.edu/4.243j/www/index.html).\_\
  It is sponsored by the\_[West Philadelphia Landscape Project](http://web.mit.edu/wplp/index.html)\_\
  and the Center for Reflective Community Practice.\n"
