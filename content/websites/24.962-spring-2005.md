course_description: 'This course focuses on phonological phenomena that are sensitive
  to morphological structure, including base-reduplicant identity, cyclicity, level
  ordering, derived environment effects, opaque rule interactions, and morpheme structure
  constraints. In the recent OT literature, it has been claimed that all of these
  phenomena can be analyzed with a single theoretical device: correspondence constraints,
  which regulate the similarity of lexically related forms (such as input and output,
  base and derivative, base and reduplicant).
