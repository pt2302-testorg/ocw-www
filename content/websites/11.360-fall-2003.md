course_description: 'This subject explores the techniques, processes, and personal
  and professional skills required to effectively manage growth and land use change.
  While primarily focused on the planning practice in the United States, the principles
  and techniques reviewed and presented may have international application. This course
  is not for bystanders; it is designed for those who wish to become actively involved
  or exposed to the planning discipline and profession as it is practiced today, and
  as it may need to be practiced in the future.
