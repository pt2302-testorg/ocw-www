course_description: 'Immune cells protect our bodies from both self-derived threats
  and exogenous pathogens, while keeping peace with normal cells and non-harmful commensal
  microbiota. They have various mechanisms to perform these tasks, a capacity that
  is essential for maintaining homeostasis. However, these same mechanisms can backfire,
  resulting in severe disorders such as immunodeficiency, chronic inflammation, allergy,
  degenerative diseases, and cancer. This course discusses the connections between
  normal physiology and disease by examining the developmental relationship between
  innate and adaptive immune cells as well as the functions and malfunctions of immune
  cells. The course familiarizes students with both basic biological principles (such
  as cell death and immune cell signaling) and clinical applications (such as immune
  checkpoint blockade). More generally, students learn to identify relevant primary
  research literature, critically evaluate experimental data, and reach their own
  conclusions based on primary data.

  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.'
