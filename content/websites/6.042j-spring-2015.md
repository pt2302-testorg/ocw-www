course_description: "This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics\
  \ oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides\
  \ roughly into thirds:\n\n1. Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs,\
  \ sets, functions, relations.\n2. Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular\
  \ arithmetic, counting.\n3. Discrete probability theory.\n\nOn completion of 6.042J,\
  \ students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous)\
  \ mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent\
  \ courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software\
  \ engineering, and computer systems.\n\nThis course is part of the [Open Learning\
  \ Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use.\_You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling."
