course_description: "In this course, we will look at many important aspects of the\
  \ circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, from length scales of meters to thousands\
  \ of km and time scales ranging from seconds to years. We will assume familiarity\
  \ with concepts covered in course\_12.003 (Physics of the Fluid Earth). In the early\
  \ stages of the present course, we will make somewhat greater use of math than did\
  \ 12.003, but the math we will use is no more than that encountered in elementary\
  \ electromagnetic field theory, for example. The focus of the course is on the **physics**\
  \ of the phenomena which we will discuss.\n"
