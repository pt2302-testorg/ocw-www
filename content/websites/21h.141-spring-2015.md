course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to major political, social,
  cultural and intellectual changes in Europe from the beginnings of the Renaissance
  in Italy around 1300 to the outbreak of the French Revolution at the end of the
  1700s. It focuses on the porous boundaries between categories of theology, magic
  and science, as well as print. It examines how developments in these areas altered
  European political institutions, social structures, and cultural practices. It also
  studies men and women, nobles and commoners, as well as Europeans and some non-Europeans
  with whom they came into contact.
