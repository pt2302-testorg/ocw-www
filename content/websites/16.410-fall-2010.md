course_description: 'This course surveys a variety of reasoning, optimization and
  decision making methodologies for creating highly autonomous systems and decision
  support aids. The focus is on principles, algorithms, and their application, taken
  from the disciplines of artificial intelligence and operations research.


  Reasoning paradigms include logic and deduction, heuristic and constraint-based
  search, model-based reasoning, planning and execution, and machine learning. Optimization
  paradigms include linear programming, integer programming, and dynamic programming.
  Decision-making paradigms include decision theoretic planning, and Markov decision
  processes.
