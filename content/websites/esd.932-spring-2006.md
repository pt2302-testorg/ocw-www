course_description: 'This course introduces the theory and the practice of engineering
  ethics using a multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural approach. Theory includes ethics
  and philosophy of engineering. Historical cases are taken primarily from the scholarly
  literatures on engineering ethics, and hypothetical cases are written by students.
  Each student will write a story by selecting an ancestor or mythic hero as a substitute
  for a character in a historical case. Students will compare these cases and recommend
  action.
