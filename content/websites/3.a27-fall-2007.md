course_description: 'TV programs such as "Law and Order" show how forensic experts
  are called upon to give testimony that often determines the outcome of court cases.
  Engineers are one class of expert who can help display evidence in a new light to
  solve cases. In this seminar you will be part of the problem-solving process, working
  through both previously solved and unsolved cases. Each week we will investigate
  cases, from the facts that make up each side to the potential evidence we can use
  as engineers to expose culprits. The cases range from disintegrating airplane engines
  to gas main explosions to Mafia murders. This seminar will be full of discussions
  about the cases and creative approaches to reaching the solutions. The approach
  is hands-on so you will have a chance to participate in the process, not simply
  study it. Some background reading and oral presentation are required.
