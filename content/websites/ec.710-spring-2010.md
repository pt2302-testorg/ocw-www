course_description: 'D-Lab Health provides a multidisciplinary approach to global
  health technology design via guest lectures and a major project based on fieldwork.
  We will explore the current state of global health challenges and learn how to design
  medical technologies that address those problems. Students may travel to Nicaragua
  during spring break to work with health professionals, using medical technology
  design kits to gain field experience for their device challenge. As a final class
  deliverable, you will create a product design solution to address challenges observed
  in the field. The resulting designs are prototyped in the summer for continued evaluation
  and testing.
