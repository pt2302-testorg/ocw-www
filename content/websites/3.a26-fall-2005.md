course_description: 'Are you interested in investigating how nature engineers itself?
  How engineers copy the shapes found in nature ("biomimetics")? This Freshman Seminar
  investigates why similar shapes occur in so many natural things and how physics
  changes the shape of nature. Why are things in nature shaped the way they are? How
  do birds fly? Why do bird nests look the way they do? How do woodpeckers peck? Why
  can''t trees grow taller than they are? Why is grass skinny and hollow? What is
  the wood science behind musical instruments? Questions such as these are the subject
  of biomimetic research and they have been the focus of investigation in this course
  for the past three years.
