course_description: 'This course surveys canonical and recent theories and methods
  in science studies. We will organize our discussions around the concept of "reproduction,"
  referring variously to:


  1.  Scientific reproduction (how results are replicated in lab, field, disciplinary
  contexts)

  2.  Social reproduction (how social knowledge and relations are regenerated over
  time)

  3.  Biological reproduction (how organic substance is managed in the genetic age)

  4.  Electronic reproduction (how information is reassembled in techniques of transcription,
  simulation, computation).


  Examining intersections and disruptions of these genres of reproduction, we seek
  to map relations among our social, biological, and electronic lives.
