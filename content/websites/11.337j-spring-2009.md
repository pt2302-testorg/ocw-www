course_description: 'In this course we examine the relationship between public policy
  and urban design through readings, discussions, presentations, and papers. We also
  analyze the ways in which policies shape cities, and investigate how governments
  implement urban design. Students gain a critical understanding of both the complex
  system of governance within which urban design occurs and the effective tools available
  for creative intervention.
