  \ in the age of genomics, biotechnological enterprise, biodiversity conservation,\
  \ pharmaceutical bioprospecting, and synthetic biology. It examines such social\
  \ concerns such as bioterrorism, genetic modification, and cloning. It offers an\
  \ anthropological inquiry into how the substances and explanations of biology\u2014\
  ecological, organismic, cellular, molecular, genetic, informatic\u2014are changing.\
  \ It examines such artifacts as cell lines, biodiversity databases, and artificial\
  \ life models, and using primary sources in biology, social studies of the life\
  \ sciences, and literary and cinematic materials, and asks how we might answer Erwin\
  \ Schrodinger's 1944 question, \"What Is Life?\" today.\n"
