course_description: 'This course has been designed as a seminar to give students an
  understanding of how scientists with medical or scientific degrees conduct research
  in both hospital and academic settings. There will be interactive discussions with
  research clinicians and scientists about the career opportunities and research challenges
  in the biomedical field, which an MIT student might prepare for by obtaining an
  MD, PhD, or combined degrees. The seminar will be held in a case presentation format,
  with topics chosen from the radiological sciences, including current research in
  magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and other nuclear imaging
  techniques, and advances in radiation therapy. With the lectures as background,
  we will also examine alternative and related options such as biomedical engineering,
  medical physics, and medical engineering. We''ll use as examples and points of comparisons
  the curriculum paths available through MIT''s Department of Nuclear Science and
  Engineering. In past years we have given very modest assignments such as readings
  in advance of or after a seminar, and a short term project.
