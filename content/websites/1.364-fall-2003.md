course_description: '1.364 examines site characterization and geotechnical aspects
  of the design and construction of foundation systems. Topics include: site investigation
  (with emphasis on in situ testing), shallow (footings and raftings) and deep (piles
  and caissons) foundations, excavation support systems, groundwater control, slope
  stability, soil improvement (compaction, soil reinforcement, etc.), and construction
  monitoring. This course is a core requirement for the Geotechnical Master of Engineering
  program at MIT.
