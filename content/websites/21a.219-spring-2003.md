course_description: "Law is a common and yet distinct aspect of everyday life in modern\
  \ societies.\_This course examines the central features of law as a social institution\
  \ and as a feature of popular culture.\_We will explore the nature of law as a set\
  \ of social systems, central actors in the systems, legal reasoning, and the relationship\
  \ of the legal form and reasoning to social change. The course emphasizes the relationship\
  \ between the internal logic of legal devices and economic, political and social\
  \ processes.\_Emphasis is placed upon developing a perspective which views law as\
  \ a practical resource, a mechanism for handling the widest range of unspecified\
  \ social issues, problems, and conflicts, and at the same time, as a set of shared\
  \ representations and aspirations.\n\nWe will explore the range of experiences of\
  \ law for its ministers (lawyers, judges, law enforcement agents and administrators)\
  \ as well as for its supplicants (citizens, plaintiffs, defendants).\_We will examine\
  \ how law is mobilized and deployed by professionals and ordinary citizens.\_We\
  \ cannot cover all aspects of the legal system, nor focus on all the different actors.\
  \ A set of topics has been selected to develop understanding of the situational\
  \ and systemic demands within which actors in the legal system operate and perform\
  \ their roles; at the same time, we will try to discover systematic patterns in\
  \ the uses and consequences of law.\_Throughout the course there is concern for\
  \ understanding what we mean by legality and the rule of law.\n"
