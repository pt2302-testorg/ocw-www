course_description: 'This course is the second of a two-term sequence with 6.450.
  The focus is on coding techniques for approaching the Shannon limit of additive
  white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, their performance analysis, and design principles.
  After a review of 6.450 and the Shannon limit for AWGN channels, the course begins
  by discussing small signal constellations, performance analysis and coding gain,
  and hard-decision and soft-decision decoding. It continues with binary linear block
  codes, Reed-Muller codes, finite fields, Reed-Solomon and BCH codes, binary linear
  convolutional codes, and the Viterbi algorithm.


  More advanced topics include trellis representations of binary linear block codes
  and trellis-based decoding; codes on graphs; the sum-product and min-sum algorithms;
  the BCJR algorithm; turbo codes, LDPC codes and RA codes; and performance of LDPC
  codes with iterative decoding. Finally, the course addresses coding for the bandwidth-limited
  regime, including lattice codes, trellis-coded modulation, multilevel coding and
  shaping. If time permits, it covers equalization of linear Gaussian channels.
