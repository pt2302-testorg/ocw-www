course_description: "This survey provides a general introduction to medieval European\
  \ literature (from Late Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century) from the perspective\
  \ of women writers from a variety of cultures, social backgrounds, and historical\
  \ timeperiods.\_Though much of the class will be devoted to exploring the evolution\
  \ of a new literary tradition by and for women from its earliest emergence in the\
  \ West, wider historical and cultural movements will also be addressed: the Fall\
  \ of the Roman Empire, the growth of religious communities, the shift from orality\
  \ to literacy, the culture of chivalry and courtly love, the emergence of scholasticism\
  \ and universities, changes in devotional practices, the persecution of heretics,\
  \ the rise of nationalism and class consciousness.\_Authors will include some of\
  \ the most famous women of the period: Hildegard of Bingen, Heloise of Paris, Marie\
  \ de France, Christine de Pizan, Joan of Arc, Margery Kempe, along with many interesting\
  \ and intriguing though lesser known figures.\n"
