course_description: 'This course uses the study of rhetoric as an opportunity to offer
  instruction in critical thinking. Through extensive writing and speaking assignments,
  students will develop their abilities to analyze texts of all kinds and to generate
  original and incisive ideas of their own. Critical thinking and original analysis
  as expressed in writing and in speech are the paramount goals of this class. The
  course will thus divide its efforts between an examination of the subject matter
  and an examination of student writing and speaking, in order to encourage in both
  instances the principal aims of the course.
