course_description: "This subject offers a broad survey of texts (both literary and\
  \ philosophical) drawn from the Western tradition and selected to trace the growth\
  \ of ideas about nature and the natural environment of mankind.\_The term _nature_\
  \ in this context has to do with the varying ways in which the physical world has\
  \ been conceived as the habitation of mankind, a source of imperatives for the collective\
  \ organization and conduct of human life. In this sense, nature is less the object\
  \ of complex scientific investigation than the object of individual experience and\
  \ direct observation. Using the term \"nature\" in this sense, we can say that modern\
  \ reference to \"the environment\" owes much to three ideas about the relation of\
  \ mankind to nature. In the first of these, which harks back to ancient medical\
  \ theories and notions about weather, geographical nature was seen as a neutral\
  \ agency affecting or transforming agent of mankind's character and institutions.\
  \ In the second, which derives from religious and classical sources in the Western\
  \ tradition, the earth was designed as a fit environment for mankind or, at the\
  \ least, as adequately suited for its abode, and civic or political life was taken\
  \ to be consonant with the natural world. In the third, which also makes its appearance\
  \ in the ancient world but becomes important only much later, nature and mankind\
  \ are regarded as antagonists, and one must conquer the other or be subjugated by\
  \ it.\n"
