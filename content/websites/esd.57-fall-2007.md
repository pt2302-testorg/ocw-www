course_description: 'This course covers how to leverage major technology advances
  to significantly transform a business in the marketplace. There is a focus on major
  issues a business must deal with to transform its technical and market strategies
  successfully, including the organizational and cultural aspects that often cause
  such business transformations to fail. Class material draws from concrete experiences
  of IBM''s major transformation in the late 1990s, when it aggressively embraced
  the Internet and came up with its e-business strategy.
