course_description: "The nuts and bolts of preparing a New Venture Plan and launching\
  \ the venture will be explored in this twenty-fifth\_annual course offering. The\
  \ course is open to members of the MIT Community and to others interested in entrepreneurship.\
  \ It is particularly recommended for persons who are interested in starting or are\
  \ involved in a new business or venture. Because some of the speakers will be judges\
  \ of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, persons who are planning to enter\
  \ the Competition should find the course particularly useful. In the past approximately\
  \ 50% of the class has been from the Engineering / Science / Architecture Schools\
  \ and 50% from the Sloan School of Management.\n\nThe course is offered during the\
  \ Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that\
  \ runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.\n"
