course_description: 'The course presents a systematic approach to design and assembly
  of mechanical assemblies, which should be of interest to engineering professionals,
  as well as post-baccalaureate students of mechanical, manufacturing and industrial
  engineering. It introduces mechanical and economic models of assemblies and assembly
  automation at two levels. "Assembly in the small" includes basic engineering models
  of part mating, and an explanation of the Remote Center Compliance. "Assembly in
  the large" takes a system view of assembly, including the notion of product architecture,
  feature-based design, and computer models of assemblies, analysis of mechanical
  constraint, assembly sequence analysis, tolerances, system-level design for assembly
  and JIT methods, and economics of assembly automation. Class exercises and homework
  include analyses of real assemblies, the mechanics of part mating, and a semester
  long project. Case studies and current research are included.
