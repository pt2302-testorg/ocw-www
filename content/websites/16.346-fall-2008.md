course_description: 'This course covers the fundamentals of astrodynamics, focusing
  on the two-body orbital initial-value and boundary-value problems with applications
  to space vehicle navigation and guidance for lunar and planetary missions, including
  both powered flight and midcourse maneuvers. Other topics include celestial mechanics,
  Kepler''s problem, Lambert''s problem, orbit determination, multi-body methods,
  mission planning, and recursive algorithms for space navigation. Selected applications
  from the Apollo, Space Shuttle, and Mars exploration programs are also discussed.
