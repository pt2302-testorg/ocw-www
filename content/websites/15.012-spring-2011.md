course_description: '_15.012 Applied Macro- and International Economics_ uses case
  studies to investigate the macroeconomic environment in which firms operate. The
  first half of the course develops the basic tools of macroeconomic management: monetary,
  fiscal, and exchange rate policy. The class discusses recent emerging market and
  financial crises by examining their causes and considering how best to address them
  and prevent them from recurring in the future. The second half evaluates different
  strategies of economic development. Topics covered in the second half of this course
  include growth, the role of debt and foreign aid, and the reliance on natural resources.
