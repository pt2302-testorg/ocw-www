course_description: 'This course presents finite element theory and methods for general
  linear and nonlinear analyses. Reliable and effective finite element procedures
  are discussed with their applications to the solution of general problems in solid,
  structural, and fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and fluid-structure interactions.
  The governing continuum mechanics equations, conservation laws, virtual work, and
  variational principles are used to establish effective finite element discretizations
  and the stability, accuracy, and convergence are discussed. The homework and the
  student-selected term project using the general-purpose finite element analysis
  program [ADINA](http://www.adina.com/) are important parts of the course.
