course_description: "This course focuses on one particular aspect of the history of\
  \ computing: the use of the computer as a scientific instrument. The electronic\
  \ digital computer was invented to do science, and its applications range from physics\
  \ to mathematics to biology to the humanities. What has been the impact of computing\
  \ on the practice of science? Is the computer different from other scientific instruments?\
  \ Is computer simulation a valid form of scientific experiment? Can computer models\
  \ be viewed as surrogate theories? How does the computer change the way scientists\
  \ approach the notions of proof, expertise, and discovery? No comprehensive history\
  \ of scientific computing has yet been written. This seminar examines scientific\
  \ articles, participants\u2019 memoirs, and works by historians, sociologists, and\
  \ anthropologists of science to provide multiple perspectives on the use of computers\
  \ in diverse fields of physical, biological, and social sciences and the humanities.\
  \ We explore how the computer transformed scientific practice, and how the culture\
  \ of computing was influenced, in turn, by scientific applications.\n"
