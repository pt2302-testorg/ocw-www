course_description: 'The topic for Fall 2006 is short film and radio plays. This course
  investigates current trends and topics in German literary, theater, film, television,
  radio, and other media arts productions. Students analyze media texts in the context
  of their production, reception, and distribution as well as the public debates initiated
  by these works. The topic for Fall 2006 is German Short Film, a popular format that
  represents most recent trends in film production, and German Radio Art, a striving
  genre that includes experimental radio plays, sound art, and audio installations.
  Special attention will be given to the representation of German minorities, contrasted
  by their own artistic expressions reflecting changes in identity and a new political
  voice. Students have the opportunity to discuss course topics with a writer, filmmaker,
  and/or media artist from Germany. The course is taught in German.
