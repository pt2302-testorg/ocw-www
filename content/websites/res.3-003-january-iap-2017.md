course_description: 'This is a 9-day hands-on workshop about designing, building,
  and publishing simple educational videogames. No previous experience with computer
  programming or videogame design is required; beginning students will be taught everything
  they need to know and advanced students will be challenged to learn new skills.
  Participants will learn about videogame creation using the Unity game engine, collaborative
  software development using GitHub, gesture handling using the Microsoft Kinect,
  3D digital object creation, videogame design, and small team management.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
