course_description: "In this sophomore design course, you will be challenged with\
  \ three design tasks: a first concerning water resources/treatment, a second concerning\
  \ structural design, and a third focusing on the conceptual (re)design of a large\
  \ system, Boston's Back Bay. The first two tasks require the design, fabrication\
  \ and testing of hardware. Several laboratory experiments will be carried out and\
  \ lectures will be presented to introduce students to the conceptual and experimental\
  \ basis for design in both domains.  \n  \nThis course was based in large part on\
  \ the Fall 2005 offering of 1.101, developed by Prof. Harold Hemond.\n"
