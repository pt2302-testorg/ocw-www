course_description: 'This course details the quantitative treatment of chemical processes
  in aquatic systems such as lakes, oceans, rivers, estuaries, groundwaters, and wastewaters.
  It includes a brief review of chemical thermodynamics that is followed by discussion
  of acid-base, precipitation-dissolution, coordination, and reduction-oxidation reactions.
  Emphasis is on equilibrium calculations as a tool for understanding the variables
  that govern the chemical composition of aquatic systems and the fate of inorganic
  pollutants.


  This course is offered through The [MIT/WHOI Joint Program](http://web.mit.edu/mit-whoi/www/).
  The MIT/WHOI Joint Program is one of the premier marine science graduate programs
  in the world. It draws on the complementary strengths and approaches of two great
  institutions: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole
  Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).
