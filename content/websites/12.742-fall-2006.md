course_description: 'This course is an introduction to chemical oceanography. It describes
  reservoir models and residence time, major ion composition of seawater, inputs to
  and outputs from the ocean via rivers, the atmosphere, and the sea floor. Biogeochemical
  cycling within the oceanic water column and sediments, emphasizing the roles played
  by the formation, transport, and alteration of oceanic particles and the effects
  that these processes have on seawater composition. Cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,
  oxygen, and sulfur. Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide by the ocean. Material
  presented through lectures and student-led presentation and discussion of recent
  papers.
