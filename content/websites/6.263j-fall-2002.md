course_description: '6.263J / 16.37J focuses on the fundamentals of data communication
  networks. One goal is to give some insight into the rationale of why networks are
  structured the way they are today and to understand the issues facing the designers
  of next-generation data networks. Much of the course focuses on network algorithms
  and their performance. Students are expected to have a strong mathematical background
  and an understanding of probability theory. Topics discussed include: layered network
  architecture, Link Layer protocols, high-speed packet switching, queueing theory,
  Local Area Networks, and Wide Area Networking issues, including routing and flow
  control.
