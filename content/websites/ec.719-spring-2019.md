course_description: "D-Lab: Water, Climate Change, and Health is a project-based,\
  \ experiential, and transdisciplinary course. Together with peers and experts, we\
  \ will explore the vitally important interface of water, climate change, and health.\
  \ This course addresses mitigation and adaptation to climate change as it pertains\
  \ to water and health. Water-borne illness, malnutrition, and vector-borne diseases\
  \ represent the top three causes of morbidity and mortality in regions of our focus.\_\
  Students submit a term project, setting the stage for a lifelong commitment to communicating\
  \ climate science to a broad public.\n"
