course_description: 'This course deals with the principles of infrastructure planning
  in developing countries, with a focus on appropriate and sustainable technologies
  for water and sanitation. It also incorporates technical, socio-cultural, public
  health, and economic factors into the planning and design of water and sanitation
  systems. Upon completion, students will be able to plan simple, yet reliable, water
  supply and sanitation systems for developing countries that are compatible with
  local customs and available human and material resources. Graduate and upper division
  students from any department who are interested in international development at
  the grassroots level are encouraged to participate in this interdisciplinary subject.
