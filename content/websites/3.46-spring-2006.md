course_description: 'This course covers the theory, design, fabrication and applications
  of photonic materials and devices. After a survey of optical materials design for
  semiconductors, dielectrics and polymers, the course examines ray optics, electromagnetic
  optics and guided wave optics; physics of light-matter interactions; and device
  design principles of LEDs, lasers, photodetectors, modulators, fiber and waveguide
  interconnects, optical filters, and photonic crystals. Device processing topics
  include crystal growth, substrate engineering, thin film deposition, etching and
  process integration for dielectric, silicon and compound semiconductor materials.
  The course also covers microphotonic integrated circuits and applications in telecom/datacom
  systems. Course assignments include four design projects that emphasize materials,
  devices and systems applications.
