course_description: 'This subject surveys main currents of European cultural and intellectual
  history in the modern period. Such a foundation course is central to the humanities
  in Europe. The curriculum introduces a set of ideas and arguments that have played
  a formative role in European cultural history, and acquaints them with some exemplars
  of critical thought. Among the topics to be considered: the critique of religion,
  the promise of independence, the advance of capitalism, the temptations of Marxism,
  the origins of totalitarianism, and the dialects of enlightenment. In addition to
  texts, we will also discuss pieces of art, incl. paintings and film.
