course_description: 'Double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA), also called Cherednik algebras,
  and their representations appear in many contexts: integrable systems (Calogero-Moser
  and Ruijsenaars models), algebraic geometry (Hilbert schemes), orthogonal polynomials,
  Lie theory, quantum groups, etc. In this course we will review the basic theory
  of DAHA and their representations, emphasizing their connections with other subjects
  and open problems.
