course_description: 'This seminar is designed to be an experimental and hands-on approach
  to applied chemistry (as seen in cooking). Cooking may be the oldest and most widespread
  application of chemistry and recipes may be the oldest practical result of chemical
  research. We shall do some cooking experiments to illustrate some chemical principles,
  including extraction, denaturation, and phase changes.
