course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to important philosophical
  questions about the mind, specifically those that are intimately connected with
  contemporary psychology and neuroscience. Are our concepts innate, or are they acquired
  by experience? (And what does it even mean to call a concept ''innate''?) Are ''mental
  images'' pictures in the head? Is color in the mind or in the world? Is the mind
  nothing more than the brain? Can there be a science of consciousness? The course
  will include guest lectures by Professors.
