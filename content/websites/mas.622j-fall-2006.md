course_description: 'This class deals with the fundamentals of characterizing and
  recognizing patterns and features of interest in numerical data. We discuss the
  basic tools and theory for signal understanding problems with applications to user
  modeling, affect recognition, speech recognition and understanding, computer vision,
  physiological analysis, and more. We also cover decision theory, statistical classification,
  maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, nonparametric methods, unsupervised
  learning and clustering. Additional topics on machine and human learning from active
  research are also talked about in the class.
