course_description: 'Our purpose is to consider some of the most elaborate and thoughtful
  efforts to define and delineate "all-mastering," and to consider some of the delineations
  of "all-mastering the intellect" in various guises - from magicians to master spies
  to detectives to scientists (mad and otherwise). The major written work of the term
  will be an ongoing reading journal, which you will circulate to your classmates
  using an e-mail mailing list. The use of that list is fundamental - it is my intention
  to generate a sort of ongoing cyberconversation.
