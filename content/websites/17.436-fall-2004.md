course_description: 'This graduate seminar introduces an emerging research program
  within International Relations on territorial conflict. While scholars have recognized
  that territory has been one of the most frequent issues over which states go to
  war, territorial conflicts have only recently become the subject of systematic study.
  This course will examine why territorial conflicts arise in the first place, why
  some of these conflicts escalate to high levels of violence and why other territorial
  disputes reach settlement, thereby reducing the likelihood of war. Readings in the
  course draw upon political geography and history as well as qualitative and quantitative
  approaches to political science.
