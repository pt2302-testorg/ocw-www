course_description: 'This subject is an introduction to various forms of culture in
  East Asia (focusing on China, Japan and Korea), including both traditional and contemporary
  examples. Critically examines the shared cultural elements that are widely considered
  to constitute "East Asian culture," and also the diversity within East Asia, historically
  and today. Examples include religious and philosophical beliefs (Confucianism and
  Buddhism), literature, art, food, architecture, and popular culture. The study of
  gender will be an integral part of this subject. The influence and presence of Asian
  cultural expressions in the U.S. are also considered.


  This class is suitable for students of all levels, and requires no Asian language
  background. Students who wish to fulfill the MISTI-Singapore requirement may do
  the final project on Singapore. Taught in English.


  The course includes field trips to the Museum of Fine Arts and the Peabody Essex
  Museum.
