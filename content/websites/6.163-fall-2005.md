course_description: 'This is a laboratory experience course with a focus on photography,
  electronic imaging, and light measurement, much of it at short duration. In addition
  to teaching these techniques, the course provides students with experience working
  in a laboratory and teaches good work habits and techniques for approaching laboratory
  work. A major purpose of 6.163 is to provide students with many opportunities to
  sharpen their communication skills: oral, written, and visual.
