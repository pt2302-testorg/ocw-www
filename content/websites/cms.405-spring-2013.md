course_description: 'In this course students create digital visual images and analyze
  designs from historical and theoretical perspectives with an emphasis on art and
  design, examining visual experience in broad terms, and from the perspectives of
  both creators and viewers. The course addresses key topics such as: image making
  as a cognitive and perceptual practice, the production of visual significance and
  meaning, and the role of technology in creating and understanding digitally produced
  images. Students will be given design problems growing out of their reading and
  present solutions using technologies such as the Adobe Creative Suite and/or similar
  applications.
