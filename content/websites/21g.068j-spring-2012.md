course_description: "In the decades following the Second World War, a cluster of extraordinary\
  \ French thinkers were widely translated and read in American universities. Their\
  \ works were soon labeled as \"French Theory.\" Why would sharing the same nationality\
  \ make authors such as Lacan, Cixous, Derrida, Foucault or Debord, ambassadors of\
  \ a specifically \"French\" theory? The course will explore the maze of transatlantic\
  \ intellectual debates since 1945 and the heyday of French existentialism. We will\
  \ study the debates on communism, decolonization, neo\u2010liberalism, gender, youth\
  \ culture and mass media. This course is taught in English.\n"
