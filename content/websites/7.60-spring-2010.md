course_description: 'The goal of this course is to teach both the fundamentals of
  nuclear cell biology as well as the methodological and experimental approaches upon
  which they are based. Lectures and class discussions will cover the background and
  fundamental findings in a particular area of nuclear cell biology. The assigned
  readings will provide concrete examples of the experimental approaches and logic
  used to establish these findings. Some examples of topics include genome and systems
  biology, transcription, and gene expression.
