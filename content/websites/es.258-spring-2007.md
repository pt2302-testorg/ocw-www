course_description: "How are math, art, music, and language intertwined? How does\
  \ intelligent behavior arise from its component parts? Can computers think? Can\
  \ brains compute? Douglas Hofstadter probes very cleverly at these questions and\
  \ more in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, \"G\xF6del, Escher, Bach\". In this seminar,\
  \ we will read and discuss the book in depth, taking the time to solve its puzzles,\
  \ appreciate the Bach pieces that inspired its dialogues, and discover its hidden\
  \ tricks along the way.\n"
