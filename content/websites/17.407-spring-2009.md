course_description: 'China''s rise as a great power raises important questions about
  how that power might be used in its relations with other states. Nowhere are such
  questions more salient than in the future trajectory of China''s conflict behavior,
  including its approach to deterrence, crisis management and the use of force. To
  explore these important questions in China''s international relations, this seminar
  examines the evolution of Chinese strategic thought, in primary sources as well
  as its reflection in the interactions among Chinese states and between China and
  other states.
