course_description: "The disciplines of music history and music theory have been slow\
  \ to embrace the digital revolutions that have transformed other fields' text-based\
  \ scholarship (history and literature in particular). Computational musicology opens\
  \ the door to the possibility of understanding\u2014even if at a broad level\u2014\
  trends and norms of behavior of large repertories of music. This class presents\
  \ the major approaches, results, and challenges of computational musicology through\
  \ readings in the field, gaining familiarity with datasets, and hands on workshops\
  \ and assignments on data analysis and \"corpus\" (i.e., repertory) studies. Class\
  \ sessions alternate between discussion/lecture and labs on digital tools for studying\
  \ music. A background in music theory and/or history is required, and experience\
  \ in computer programming will be extremely helpful. Coursework culminates in an\
  \ independent research project in quantitative or computational musicology that\
  \ will be presented to the class as a whole.\n"
