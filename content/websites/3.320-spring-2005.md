course_description: 'This course uses the theory and application of atomistic computer
  simulations to model, understand, and predict the properties of real materials.
  Specific topics include: energy models from classical potentials to first-principles
  approaches; density functional theory and the total-energy pseudopotential method;
  errors and accuracy of quantitative predictions: thermodynamic ensembles, Monte
  Carlo sampling and molecular dynamics simulations; free energy and phase transitions;
  fluctuations and transport properties; and coarse-graining approaches and mesoscale
  models. The course employs case studies from industrial applications of advanced
  materials to nanotechnology. Several laboratories will give students direct experience
  with simulations of classical force fields, electronic-structure approaches, molecular
  dynamics, and Monte Carlo.


  This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)
  (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5107 (Atomistic Computer Modeling of Materials).
