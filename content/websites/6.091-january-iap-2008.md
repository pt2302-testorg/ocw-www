course_description: 'This course introduces students to both passive and active electronic
  components (op-amps, 555 timers, TTL digital circuits). Basic analog and digital
  circuits and theory of operation are covered. The labs allow the students to master
  the use of electronic instruments and construct and/or solder several circuits.
  The labs also reinforce the concepts discussed in class with a hands-on approach
  and allow the students to gain significant experience with electrical instruments
  such as function generators, digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers
  and power supplies. In the last lab, the students build an electronic circuit that
  they can keep. The course is geared to freshmen and others who want an introduction
  to electronics circuits.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
