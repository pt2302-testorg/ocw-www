course_description: 'This subject exposes students to a variety of visualization techniques
  so that they learn to understand the work involved in producing them and to critically
  assess the power and limits of each. Students concentrate on areas where visualizations
  are crucial for meaning making and data production. Drawing on scholarship in science
  and technology studies on visualization, critical art theory, and core discussions
  in science and engineering, students work through a series of case studies in order
  to become better readers and producers of visualizations.
