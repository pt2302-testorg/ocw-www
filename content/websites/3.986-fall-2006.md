course_description: 'This class introduces the multidisciplinary nature of archaeology,
  both in theory and practice. Lectures provide a comparative examination of the origins
  of agriculture and the rise of early civilizations in the ancient Near East and
  Mesoamerica. The laboratory sessions provide practical experience in aspects of
  archaeological field methods and analytical techniques including the examination
  of stone, ceramic, and metal artifacts and bone materials. Lab sessions have occasional
  problem sets which are completed outside of class.
