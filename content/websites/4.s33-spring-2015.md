course_description: 'Over the last 40 years, new managerial technologies in Western
  democratic societies have emerged to dominate our perceived and lived reality. Demands
  for autonomy and a creative life, which have been the touchstones for artistic endeavors,
  have been readily absorbed into management philosophies, becoming normative values
  for self-management and entrepreneurial innovation. Is this art''s triumph or demise?
  Can we imagine other worlds beyond our managed reality and propose forms of living
  not yet captured by the rationality of network capitalism? We will explore the "creative"
  figure and how it can shape renewed critical expressions in fields such as technology,
  design, science, philosophy, etc.
