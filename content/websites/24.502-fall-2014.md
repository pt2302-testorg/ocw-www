course_description: "This is a class about 'ought' and ought\u2014you can think of\
  \ it as a class in philosophy of language and metaphysics in which the focus is\
  \ the ethical sphere. Some of the questions that we will broach include: How should\
  \ we give a semantics for 'ought' generally? Is there anything special about the\
  \ ethical 'ought'? Is there anything that you ethically ought to do, e.g., give\
  \ to charity or refrain from stealing?\n"
