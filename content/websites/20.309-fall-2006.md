course_description: 'This course covers sensing and measurement for quantitative molecular/cell/tissue
  analysis, in terms of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical properties. Methods
  include light and fluorescence microscopies; electro-mechanical probes such as atomic
  force microscopy, laser and magnetic traps, and MEMS devices; and the application
  of statistics, probability and noise analysis to experimental data. Enrollment preference
  is given to juniors and seniors.
