course_description: 'Political Economy I explores the major social science paradigms
  for analyzing relations among state, economy, and society. Through readings, lectures
  and discussion of original texts in political liberalism and individualism, neo-classical
  economics, Marxism, sociological and cultural theories, and neo-institutionalism,
  the seminar examines the fundamental assumptions on which our understanding of the
  social world and our research are based.
