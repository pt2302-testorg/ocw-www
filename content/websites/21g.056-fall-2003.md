course_description: 'This course is an invitation to German film-making since the
  end of the Second World War. We investigate how German cinema captured the atmosphere
  of the immediate post-war years and discuss extensively major works of the "New
  German Cinema" of the Sixties and Seventies. We also look at examples of East Germany''s
  film production and finally observe the very different roads German cinema has been
  taking from the 1990''s into the present.
