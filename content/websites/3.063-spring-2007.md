course_description: 'This course presents the mechanical, optical, and transport properties
  of polymers with respect to the underlying physics and physical chemistry of polymers
  in melt, solution, and solid state. Topics include conformation and molecular dimensions
  of polymer chains in solutions, melts, blends, and block copolymers; an examination
  of the structure of glassy, crystalline, and rubbery elastic states of polymers;
  thermodynamics of polymer solutions, blends, crystallization; liquid crystallinity,
  microphase separation, and self-assembled organic-inorganic nanocomposites. Case
  studies include relationships between structure and function in technologically
  important polymeric systems.
