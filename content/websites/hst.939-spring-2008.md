course_description: 'Innovation in global health practice requires leaders who are
  trained to think and act like entrepreneurs. Whether at a hospital bedside or in
  a remote village, global healthcare leaders must understand both the business of
  running a social venture as well as how to plan for and provide access to life saving
  medicines and essential health services.


  Each week, the course features a lecture and skills-based tutorial session led by
  industry, non-profit foundation, technology, and academic leaders to think outside
  the box in tackling and solving problems in innovation for global health practice
  through the rationale design of technology and service solutions. The lectures provide
  the foundation for faculty-mentored pilot project from MOH, students, or non-profit
  sponsors that may involve creation of a market or business plan, product development,
  or a research study design.
