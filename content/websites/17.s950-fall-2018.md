course_description: 'This course is premised on the belief that emotions are a fundamental
  part of human nature. Accordingly, understanding emotions and incorporating emotions
  into our research can help us better explain variation in important political phenomena.
  Research on emotions and how emotions can influence decision-making has dramatically
  increased over the past two decades. This class aims to pick up on new findings
  from psychology and other disciplines and marshal this knowledge toward the most
  important issues of political science.
