course_description: 'This course covers topics and questions such as: What is poverty?
  How is it defined and measured in the United States and other countries? What are
  the different program designs that countries use to relieve poverty? To answer these
  questions, the course examines the main public policy frames that guide theory,
  research, policy, and practice. How do the definition and policies to deal with
  poverty change over time? What are the economic, political, and social forces that
  contribute to the persistence of poverty and its periodic reframing? Can social
  science to help to resolve the public policy debates that make poverty and its relief
  so controversial?
