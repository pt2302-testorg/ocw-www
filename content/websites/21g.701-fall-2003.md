course_description: 'Spanish I is very different from other classes at MIT. The central
  component of the text and workbook is a series of 26 half-hour video episodes. The
  videos allow students to learn authentic Spanish and experience its cultural diversity
  while following a good story full of surprises and human emotions. Students also
  listen to an audio-only program integrated with the text and workbook.


  In the classroom, students do a variety of activities and exercises, which include
  talking in Spanish about the video program, practicing pronunciation and grammar,
  and interacting in Spanish with classmates in pairs and small groups. The class
  is conducted in Spanish as much as possible, but English is used where necessary
  for clarity and efficiency. This course deals with all basic language skills: aural
  comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. This class assumes no previous knowledge
  of Spanish.
