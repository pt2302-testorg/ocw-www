course_description: "In this course, you will learn the principles of genetics with\
  \ application to the study of biological function at the level of molecules, cells,\
  \ and multicellular organisms, including humans. We will cover structure and function\
  \ of genes, chromosomes, and genomes; biological variation resulting from recombination,\
  \ mutation, and selection; population genetics; and the use of genetic methods to\
  \ modify genes and genomes and analyze protein function, gene regulation, and inherited\
  \ disease.\n\nThis course, based on the MIT course *7.03 Genetics* taken by enrolled\
  \ MIT students, was organized as a three-part series on [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx)\
  \ by [MIT\u2019s Department of Biology](https://biology.mit.edu/) (Note: The third\
  \ part of the course is not available yet). It is [self-paced and free](https://web.mit.edu/mitxbio/courses.html)\
  \ as long as you enroll in the Audit Track option, which you can select after creating\
  \ a free account on edX."
