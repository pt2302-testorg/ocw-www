course_description: 'The major focus of 16.13 is on boundary layers, and boundary
  layer theory subject to various flow assumptions, such as compressibility, turbulence,
  dimensionality, and heat transfer. Parameters influencing aerodynamic flows and
  transition and influence of boundary layers on outer potential flow are presented,
  along with associated stall and drag mechanisms. Numerical solution techniques and
  exercises are included.
