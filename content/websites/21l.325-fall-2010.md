course_description: 'The "small wonders" to which our course will attend are moments
  of present time, depicted in the verbal and visual media of the modern age: newspapers,
  novels and stories, poems, photographs, films, etc. We will move between visual
  and verbal media across a considerable span of time, from eighteenth-century poetry
  and prose fiction to twenty-first century social networking and microblogging sites,
  and from sculpture to photography, film, and digital visual media. With help from
  philosophers, contemporary cultural historians, and others, we will begin to think
  about a media practice largely taken for granted in our own moment.
