course_description: 'This class focuses on chemical rocket propulsion systems for
  launch, orbital, and interplanetary flight. It studies the modeling of solid, liquid-bipropellant,
  and hybrid rocket engines. Thermochemistry, prediction of specific impulse, and
  nozzle flows including real gas and kinetic effects will also be covered. Other
  topics to be covered include structural constraints, propellant feed systems, turbopumps,
  and combustion processes in solid, liquid, and hybrid rockets.
