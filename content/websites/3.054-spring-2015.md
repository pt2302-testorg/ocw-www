course_description: 'This course reviews the processing and structure of cellular
  materials as they are created from polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, and composites,
  develops models for the mechanical behavior of cellular solids, and shows how the
  unique properties of honeycombs and foams are exploited in applications such as
  lightweight structural panels, energy absorption devices and thermal insulation.
  The applications of cellular solids in medicine include increased fracture risk
  due to trabecular bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, the development of metal
  foam coatings for orthopaedic implants, and designing porous scaffolds for tissue
  engineering that mimic the extracellular matrix. Modelling of cellular materials
  applied to natural materials and biomimicking is explored. Students taking the graduate
  version of the class are required to complete additional assignments.
