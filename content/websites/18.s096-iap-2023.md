course_description: 'We all know that calculus courses such as [*18.01 Single Variable
  Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)
  and [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
  cover univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as
  machine learning and large-scale optimization require the next big step, "matrix
  calculus" and calculus on arbitrary vector spaces.


  This class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that
  allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), generalize
  and compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations and many other complicated-looking
  operations, and understand how differentiation formulas must be re-imagined in large-scale
  computing.'
