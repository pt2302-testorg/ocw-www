course_description: '_6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python_
  is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide
  students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems
  and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their
  ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The
  class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.
