course_description: "This course will provide students with an analytic framework\
  \ to understand the roles that gender, race, and class play in defining and determining\
  \ access to leadership and power in the U.S., especially in the context of the workplace.\
  \ We will explore women and men in leadership positions within the corporate, political\
  \ and non-profit sectors, with attention to the roles of women of color and immigrant\
  \ women within this context. We will also look at specific policies such as affirmative\
  \ action, parental leave, child-care policy, and working-time policies and the role\
  \ they play\u2013or could play\u2013in achieving parity. We will further investigate\
  \ ways in which these policies address gender, racial, and class inequities, and\
  \ think critically about mechanisms for change. The course will be highly interactive,\
  \ and will combine texts, theater, videos and visual arts.\n"
