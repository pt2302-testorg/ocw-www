course_description: 'The aim of the Portfolio Seminar is to assist in developing a
  critical position in relationship to their design work. By engaging multiple forms
  of representation, written and visual, students will explore methods that facilitate
  describing and representing their design work. Through a critical assessment of
  their existing portfolios, students will first be challenged to articulate design
  theses and interests in their past projects. Different mediums of representation
  will then be studied in order to hone an understanding of the relationship between
  form and content, and more specifically, the understanding of particular modes of
  representation as different filters through which their work can be read. Some of
  the questions that will be addressed are:


  *   How does one go about describing an image?

  *   How does one theorize representation?

  *   How does one articulate a design thesis in writing verses visual media?

  *   How can the two interact to enhance each other?

  *   How do different media, printed verses web publishing, affect the representation
  of work?

  *   How is your work best communicated?
