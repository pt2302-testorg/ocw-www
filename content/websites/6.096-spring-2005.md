course_description: 'This course is offered to undergraduates and addresses several
  algorithmic challenges in computational biology. The principles of algorithmic design
  for biological datasets are studied and existing algorithms analyzed for application
  to real datasets. Topics covered include: biological sequence analysis, gene identification,
  regulatory motif discovery, genome assembly, genome duplication and rearrangements,
  evolutionary theory, clustering algorithms, and scale-free networks.
