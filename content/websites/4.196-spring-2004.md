course_description: "This architectural studio will have one main project for the\
  \ semester:\_to explore the issues surrounding the redesign of an area in Havana,\
  \ Cuba. It is a typical area about the size of a Law of Indies block that presently\
  \ has a mix of housing, work, and shopping, in buildings that need to be replaced\
  \ and others that need to be rehabilitated. There is also vacant land, and buildings\
  \ that are unused. Part of the blocks front on the Malecon, the street next to the\
  \ water. The other edge fronts onto a typical neighborhood. The intention is to\
  \ study the culture through an understanding of one area of Havana and then design\
  \ an \"echo\" in architectural form. The design will include public space as well\
  \ as a mix of buildings: some new, some rehabilitated.\n"
