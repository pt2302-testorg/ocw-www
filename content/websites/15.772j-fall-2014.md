course_description: 'This course introduces concepts of supply chain design and operations
  with a focus on supply chains for products destined to improve quality of life in
  developing countries. Topics include demand estimation, capacity planning and process
  analysis, inventory management, and supply chain coordination and performance. We
  also cover issues specific to emerging markets, such as sustainable supply chains,
  how to couple product design with supply chain design and operation, and how to
  account for the value-adding role of a supply chain. A major aspect of class is
  the student projects on supply chain design or improvement.
