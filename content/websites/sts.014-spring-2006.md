course_description: 'This course helps in developing skills as science communicators
  through projects and analysis of theoretical principles. Case studies explore the
  emergence of popular science communication over the past two centuries and consider
  the relationships among authors, audiences and media. Project topics are identified
  early in the term and students work with MIT Museum staff. Projects may include
  physical exhibits, practical demonstrations, or scripts for public programs.
