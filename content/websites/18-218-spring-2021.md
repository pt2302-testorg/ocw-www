course_description: In this course, we will mostly be studying Fourier analysis of
  Boolean functions, which is a useful tool in theoretical computer science, combinatorics,
  and more. We will start with basic concepts such as influences, noise sensitivity,
  and hypercontractivity and some basic results in the area.
