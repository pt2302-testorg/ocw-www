course_description: 'The primary role of mitochondria is to produce 90% of a cell''s
  energy in the form of ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. A
  variety of clinical disorders have been shown to include "mitochondrial dysfunction,"
  which loosely refers to defective oxidative phosphorylation and usually coincides
  with the occurrence of excess Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, placing
  cells under oxidative stress. A known cause and effect of oxidative stress is damage
  to and mutation of mitochondrial DNA. We will use this class to explore issues relating
  to mitochondrial DNA integrity and how it can be damaged, repaired, mutated, and
  compromised in human diseases.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
