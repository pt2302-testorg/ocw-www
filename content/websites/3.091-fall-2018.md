course_description: "In this course, we will explore what makes things in the world\
  \ the way they are and why, to understand the science and consider the engineering.\
  \ We learn not only why the physical world behaves the way it does, but also how\
  \ to think with chemical intuition, which can\u2019t be gained simply by observing\
  \ the macroscopic world.\n\nThis 2018 version of 3.091 by Jeffrey Grossman and the\
  \ 2010 OCW version by Don Sadoway cover similar topics and both provide complete\
  \ learning materials. This 2018 version also includes Jeffrey Grossman\u2019s innovative\
  \ Goodie Bags, Why This Matters, and CHEMATLAS content, as well as additional practice\
  \ problems, quizzes, and exams.\n"
