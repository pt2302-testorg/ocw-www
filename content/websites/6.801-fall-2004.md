course_description: 'Machine Vision provides an intensive introduction to the process
  of generating a symbolic description of an environment from an image. Lectures describe
  the physics of image formation, motion vision, and recovering shapes from shading.
  Binary image processing and filtering are presented as preprocessing steps. Further
  topics include photogrammetry, object representation alignment, analog VLSI and
  computational vision. Applications to robotics and intelligent machine interaction
  are discussed.
