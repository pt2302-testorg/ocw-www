course_description: 'This course studies fundamental design and implementation ideas
  in the engineering of operating systems. Lectures are based on a study of UNIX and
  research papers. Topics include virtual memory, threads, context switches, kernels,
  interrupts, system calls, interprocess communication, coordination, and the interaction
  between software and hardware. Individual laboratory assignments involve implementation
  of a small operating system in C, with some x86 assembly.
