course_description: "This half-semester Samplings course, worth six instead of the\
  \ typical twelve credits, drew attention to the thirteen female Nobel laureates.\_\
  As the [MIT Literature website](http://lit.mit.edu/curriculum/samplings/) explains,\
  \ Samplings serve students looking for \"a less intensive, more discussion and reading\
  \ oriented way of continuing literary study.\" Secondly, \"they allow the Literature\
  \ Faculty to offer occasional subjects that cannot be permanently and regularly\
  \ offered. Finally, they are a site of experimentation\u2014a way of trying out\
  \ new authors and new themes.\"\n"
