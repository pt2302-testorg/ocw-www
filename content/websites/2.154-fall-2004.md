course_description: "This course is about maneuvering motions of surface and underwater\
  \ vehicles. Topics covered include: derivation of equations of motion, hydrodynamic\
  \ coefficients, memory effects, linear and nonlinear forms of the equations of motion,\
  \ control surfaces modeling and design, engine, propulsor, and transmission systems\
  \ modeling and simulation during maneuvering. The course also deals with\_stability\
  \ of motion, principles of multivariable automatic control, optimal control, Kalman\
  \ filtering, and loop transfer recovery. We will also explore applications chosen\
  \ from autopilots for surface vehicles; towing in open seas; and remotely operated\
  \ vehicles.\n\nThis course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean\
  \ Engineering) as 13.49. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course\
  \ 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.154.\n"
