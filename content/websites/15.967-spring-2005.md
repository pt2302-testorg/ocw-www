course_description: 'This is a course intended to give students a broad overview of
  the management challenges of the non-profit sector. It is not a detailed management
  course but rather is aimed at students who will likely relate to non-profits in
  a variety of ways (on the boards, as volunteers, as fund-raisers, and occasionally
  as staff).
