course_description: "This five-day program on evaluating social programs will provide\
  \ a thorough understanding of randomized evaluations and pragmatic step-by-step\
  \ training for conducting one's own evaluation. While the course focuses on randomized\
  \ evaluations, many of the topics, such as measuring outcomes and dealing with threats\
  \ to the validity of an evaluation, are relevant for other methodologies.\n\nAbout\
  \ the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab\n-----------------------------------------------\n\
  \nJ-PAL's goal is to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is based on scientific\
  \ evidence. Every day, evidence generated by J-PAL researchers is influencing policy\
  \ and improving lives, sometimes very directly \u2013 for example through the scale-up\
  \ of effective programs \u2013 but also in less direct but equally important ways.\n\
  \nTo date, our evidence has helped improve the lives of at least 30 million people\
  \ around the world through the scale-up of highly effective policies and programs.\
  \ By 2013, J-PAL aims to have positively impacted 100 million lives.\n"
