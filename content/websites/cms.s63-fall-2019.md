course_description: 'Students explore augmented reality audio through the design and
  evaluation of prototypes. Participants will probe design space and illuminate creative
  possibilities. This includes productive, playful, and social applications, as well
  as the intersection between games and music. The course builds understanding of
  the limitations and strengths of iterative design and rapid prototyping as research
  methods, familiarizes students with the theoretical foundations of design exploration,
  and practices working with physical and digital materials.
