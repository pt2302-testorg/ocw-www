course_description: 'This course describes the processes by which mass, momentum,
  and energy are transported in plasmas, with special reference to magnetic confinement
  fusion applications.


  The Fokker-Planck collision operator and its limiting forms, as well as collisional
  relaxation and equilibrium, are considered in detail. Special applications include
  a Lorentz gas, Brownian motion, alpha particles, and runaway electrons.


  The Braginskii formulation of classical collisional transport in general geometry
  based on the Fokker-Planck equation is presented.


  Neoclassical transport in tokamaks, which is sensitive to the details of the magnetic
  geometry, is considered in the high (Pfirsch-Schluter), low (banana) and intermediate
  (plateau) regimes of collisionality.
