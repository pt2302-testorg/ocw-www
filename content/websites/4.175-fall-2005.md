course_description: 'This course serves as an introduction to urban form and design,
  focusing on the physical, historical, and social form of cities. Selected cities
  are analyzed, drawn, and compared, to develop a working understanding of urban and
  architectural form. The development of map making and urban representation is discussed,
  and use of the computer is required. A special focus is placed on the historical
  development of the selected cities, especially mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth
  century periods of expansion. Readings focus on urban design theory in the twentieth
  century and will be discussed during a weekly seminar on them. This is a methods
  class for S.M.Arch.S. students in Architecture and Urbanism.
