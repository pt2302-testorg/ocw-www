course_description: 'This seminar provides intensive study of exciting texts by four
  influential American authors. In studying paired works, we can enrich our sense
  of each author''s distinctive methods, get a deeper sense of the development of
  their careers, and shake up our preconceptions about what makes an author or a work
  "great." Students will get an opportunity to research an author in depth, as well
  as making broader comparisons across the syllabus.
