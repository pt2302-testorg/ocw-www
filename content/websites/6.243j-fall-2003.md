course_description: "This course provides an\_introduction to nonlinear deterministic\
  \ dynamical systems. Topics covered include: nonlinear ordinary differential equations;\
  \ planar autonomous systems; fundamental theory: Picard iteration, contraction mapping\
  \ theorem, and Bellman-Gronwall lemma; stability of equilibria by Lyapunov's first\
  \ and second methods; feedback linearization; and application to nonlinear circuits\
  \ and control systems.\n"
