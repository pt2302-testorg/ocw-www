course_description: 'This course provides an overview of the distinctive features
  which distinguish sound categories of languages of the world. Theories which relate
  these categories to their acoustic and articulatory correlates, both universally
  and in particular languages, are covered. Models of word recognition by listeners,
  features, and phonological structure are also discussed. In addition, the course
  offers a variety of perspectives on these issues, drawn from Electrical Engineering,
  Linguistics and Cognitive Science.
