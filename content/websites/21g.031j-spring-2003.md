course_description: "21G.031 examines the terms \"avant garde\" and \"Kulturindustrie\"\
  \ in French and German culture of the early twentieth century. Considering the origins\
  \ of these concepts in surrealist and dadaist literature, art, and cinema, the course\
  \ then expands to engage parallel formations across Europe, particularly in the\
  \ former Soviet Union. Emphasis on the specific historical conditions that enabled\
  \ these interventions. Guiding questions are these: What was original about the\
  \ historical avant-garde?\_What connections between art and revolution did avant-garde\
  \ writers and artists imagine? What strategies did they deploy to meet their modernist\
  \ imperatives? To what extent did their projects maintain a critical stance towards\
  \ the culture industry?\n\nSurveying key interventions in the fields of poetry,\
  \ painting, sculpture, photography, film, and music, the readings also include signal\
  \ moments in critical thought of the last century. Figures to be considered are:\
  \ Adorno, Aragon, Bataille, Beckett, Brecht, Breton, B\xFCrger, Duchamp, Eisenstein,\
  \ Ernst, J\xFCnger, Greenberg, Kandinsky, Malevich, Mayakovsky, and Tzara. Taught\
  \ in English, but students are encouraged to consult original sources when possible.\n"
