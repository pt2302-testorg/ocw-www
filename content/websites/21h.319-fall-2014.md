course_description: 'This seminar looks at key issues in the historical development
  and current state of modern American criminal justice, with an emphasis on its relationship
  to citizenship, nationhood, and race/ethnicity. We begin with a range of perspectives
  on the rise of what is often called "mass incarceration": how did our current system
  of criminal punishment take shape, and what role did race play in that process?
  Part Two takes up a series of case studies, including racial disparities in the
  administration of the death penalty, enforcement of the drug laws, and the regulation
  of police investigations. The third and final part of the seminar looks at national
  security policing: the development of a constitutional law governing the intersection
  of ethnicity, religion, and counter-terrorism, and the impact of counter-terrorism
  policy on domestic police practices.
