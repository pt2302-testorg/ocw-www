course_description: 'In this course, we will address how transcriptional regulators
  both prohibit and drive differentiation during the course of development. How does
  a stem cell know when to remain a stem cell and when to become a specific cell type?
  Are there global differences in the way the genome is read in multipotent and terminally
  differentiated cells? We will explore how stem cell pluripotency is preserved, how
  master regulators of cell-fate decisions execute developmental programs, and how
  chromatin regulators control undifferentiated versus differentiated states. Additionally,
  we will discuss how aberrant regulation of transcriptional regulators produces disorders
  such as developmental defects and cancer.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
