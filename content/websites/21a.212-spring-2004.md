course_description: "Human beings are symbol-making as well as tool-making animals.\
  \ We understand our world and shape our lives in large part by assigning meanings\
  \ to objects, beings, and persons; by connecting things together in symbolic patterns;\
  \ and by creating elaborate forms of symbolic action and narrative.\_In this introductory\
  \ subject we consider how symbols are created and structured; how they draw on and\
  \ give meaning to different domains of the human world; how they are woven into\
  \ politics, family life, and the life cycle; and how we can interpret them.\n\n\
  The semester will be devoted to a number of topics in symbolism.\n\n1.  Metaphor\
  \ and Other Figurative Language\n2.  The Raw Materials of Symbolism, especially\
  \ Animals and The Human Body\n3.  Cosmology and Complex Symbolic Systems\n4.  Ritual,\
  \ including Symbolic Curing and Magic\n5.  Narrative and Life\n6.  Mythology\n"
