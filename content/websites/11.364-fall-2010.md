course_description: 'This seminar will explore the difficulties of getting agreement
  on global definitions of sustainability; in particularly building international
  support for efforts to combat climate change created by greenhouse gas emissions
  as well as other international resource management efforts. We will focus on possible
  changes in the way global environmental agreements are formulated and implemented,
  especially on ways of shifting from the current "pollution control" approach to
  combating climate change to a more comprehensive strategy for taking advantage of
  sustainable development opportunities.
