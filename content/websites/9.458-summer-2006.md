course_description: "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, degenerative\
  \ disease of the brain that produces movement disorders and deficits in executive\
  \ functions, working memory, visuospatial functions, and internal control of attention.\
  \ It is named after James Parkinson (1755-1824), the English neurologist who described\
  \ the first case.\n\nThis six-week summer workshop explored different aspects of\
  \ PD, including clinical characteristics, structural neuroimaging, neuropathology,\
  \ genetics, and cognitive function (mental status, cognitive control processes,\
  \ working memory, and long-term declarative memory).\_ The workshop did not take\
  \ up the topics of motor control, nondeclarative memory, or treatment.\n"
