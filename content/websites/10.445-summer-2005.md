course_description: 'This course serves as an introduction to the fundamental principles
  of separation operations for the recovery of products from biological processes,
  membrane filtration, chromatography, centrifugation, cell disruption, extraction,
  and process design.


  This course was last taught during the regular school year in the Spring semester
  of 1999, but has been a part of the MIT Technology and Development Program ([TDP](http://web.mit.edu/mit-tdp/www/))
  at the Malaysia University of Science and Technology ([MUST](http://web.mit.edu/mit-tdp/www/pp-malaysia.html)),
  as well as at [MIT''s Professional Institute](http://web.mit.edu/mitpep/pi/) in
  more recent years.
