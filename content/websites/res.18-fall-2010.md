course_description: 'Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources
  that covers the materials normally found in a freshman-level introductory calculus
  course. The series was first released in 1970 as a way for people to review the
  essentials of calculus. It is equally valuable for students who are learning calculus
  for the first time.
