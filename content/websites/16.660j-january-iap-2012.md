course_description: 'This course covers the fundamental principles, practices and
  tools of Lean Six Sigma methods that underlay modern organizational productivity
  approaches applied in aerospace, automotive, health care, and other sectors. It
  includes lectures, active learning exercises, a plant tour, talks by industry practitioners,
  and videos. One third of the course is devoted to a physical simulation of an aircraft
  manufacturing enterprise or a clinic to illustrate the power of Lean Six Sigma methods.


  The course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a
  special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end
  of the month.
