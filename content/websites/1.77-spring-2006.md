course_description: 'The course material emphasizes mathematical models for predicting
  distribution and fate of effluents discharged into lakes, reservoirs, rivers, estuaries,
  and oceans. It also focuses on formulation and structure of models as well as analytical
  and simple numerical solution techniques. Also discussed are the role of element
  cycles, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, as water quality indicators; offshore
  outfalls and diffusion; salinity intrusion in estuaries; and thermal stratification,
  eutrophication, and sedimentation processes in lakes and reservoirs. This course
  is a core requirement for the Environmental MEng program.
