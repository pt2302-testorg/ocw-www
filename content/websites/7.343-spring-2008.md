course_description: 'In this course, we will discuss the microbial physiology and
  genetics of stress responses in aquatic ecosystems, astrobiology, bacterial pathogenesis
  and other environments. We will learn about classical and novel methods utilized
  by researchers to uncover bacterial mechanisms induced under both general and environment-specific
  stresses. Finally, we will compare and contrast models for bacterial stress responses
  to gain an understanding of distinct mechanisms of survival and of why there are
  differences among bacterial genera.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting.
