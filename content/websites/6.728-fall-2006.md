course_description: '6.728 is offered under the department''s "Devices, Circuits,
  and Systems" concentration. The course covers concepts in elementary quantum mechanics
  and statistical physics, introduces applied quantum physics, and emphasizes an experimental
  basis for quantum mechanics. Concepts covered include: Schrodinger''s equation applied
  to the free particle, tunneling, the harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen atom, variational
  methods, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, and Boltzmann distribution functions, and simple
  models for metals, semiconductors, and devices such as electron microscopes, scanning
  tunneling microscope, thermonic emitters, atomic force microscope, and others.
