course_description: 'This course explores how gender shaped the historical experiences
  and cultural productions in the North American West during the time it was being
  explored, settled, and imagined. The North American West of the late nineteenth
  and early twentieth centuries provides a fascinating case study of the shifting
  meanings of gender, race, citizenship, and power in border societies. As the site
  of migration, settlement, and displacement, it spawned contests over land, labor
  disputes, inter-ethnic conflicts and peaceful relations, and many kinds of cultural
  productions.
