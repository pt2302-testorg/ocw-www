course_description: 'This course examines the development of the western intellectual
  tradition from the fall of the Roman Empire through the High Middle Ages. Our basic
  premise will be that the triumph of Christianity in the west was not the inevitable
  outcome it might appear from hindsight. Our attention will therefore be focused
  not only on the development of Christian thought and practice, but on its challengers
  as well. The core themes of the course include the emergence of a uniform Christian
  orthodoxy in late antiquity; the development of monastic practice and its attendant
  intellectual traditions; and the geographical spread of Christian beliefs. Working
  in opposition to those trends were other forces, which we will also address in our
  readings. In particular, we will consider the persistence of northern paganism;
  the rise of Islam; the solidification of a separate Byzantine orthodoxy; indigenous
  heretical movements; and the ambiguous position of Jews in all of European society.
