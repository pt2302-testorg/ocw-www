course_description: 'This course gives an introduction to the science of linguistic
  meaning. There are two branches to this discipline: semantics, the study of conventional,
  "compositional meaning", and pragmatics, the study of interactional meaning. There
  are other contributaries: philosophy, logic, syntax, and psychology. We will try
  to give you an understanding of the concepts of semantics and pragmatics and of
  some of the technical tools that we use.
