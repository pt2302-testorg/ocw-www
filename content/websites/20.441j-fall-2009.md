course_description: 'This course covers the principles of materials science and cell
  biology underlying the design of medical implants, artificial organs, and matrices
  for tissue engineering. Methods for biomaterials surface characterization and analysis
  of protein adsorption on biomaterials. Molecular and cellular interactions with
  biomaterials are analyzed in terms of unit cell processes, such as matrix synthesis,
  degradation, and contraction. Mechanisms underlying wound healing and tissue remodeling
  following implantation in various organs. Tissue and organ regeneration. Design
  of implants and prostheses based on control of biomaterials-tissue interactions.
  Comparative analysis of intact, biodegradable, and bioreplaceable implants by reference
  to case studies. Criteria for restoration of physiological function for tissues
  and organs.
