course_description: 'This course explores how social theories of urban life can be
  related to the city''s architecture and spaces. It is grounded in classic or foundational
  writings about the city addressing such topics as the public realm and public space,
  impersonality, crowds and density, surveillance and civility, imprinting time on
  space, spatial justice, and the segregation of difference. The aim of the course
  is to generate new ideas about the city by connecting the social and the physical,
  using Boston as a visual laboratory. Students are required to present a term paper
  mediating what is read with what has been observed.
