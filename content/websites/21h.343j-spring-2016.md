course_description: 'This course explores the impact of new technology on the recording
  and distribution of words and images at three different times: The invention of
  the printing press ca. 1450; the adaptation of electricity to communication technology
  in the 19th century (telegraph, telephone, phonograph); and the emergence of digital
  media today. Assignments include essays and online projects. Students also participate
  in the design and construction of a hand-set printing press.


  This course is also part of the [Concourse](http://concourse.mit.edu/) program at
  MIT.'
