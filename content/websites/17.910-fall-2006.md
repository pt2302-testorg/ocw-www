course_description: 'This course examines the politics of international economic relations.
  We begin with a discussion of the analytical "lenses" through which we can view
  the global economy. We then examine the politics of trade policy, multinational
  corporations, and international monetary and financial relations. We will also examine
  third-world development, communist transition, and the debate over "globalization."
  Finally we will explore the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering,
  the proper role of international financial institutions (including the IMF), and
  the impact of the global economy on the ability of governments to make policy within
  their own borders.
