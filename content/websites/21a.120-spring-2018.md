course_description: 'This course explores the experiences and understandings of class
  among Americans positioned at different points along the U.S. social spectrum. It
  considers a variety of classic frameworks for analyzing social class and uses memoirs,
  novels, and ethnographies to gain a sense of how class is experienced in daily life
  and how it intersects with other forms of social difference such as race and gender.
