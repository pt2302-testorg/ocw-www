course_description: Environmentalists have traditionally relied upon the power of
  their prose to transform the thoughts and behavior of their contemporaries. In 1963,
  Rachel Carson, a marine biologist with a penchant for writing, described a world
  without wildlife in *Silent Spring* and altered the way Americans understood their
  impact on the landscape. Like other writers we will encounter this semester, Carson
  realized that she could alter the perceptions of her contemporaries only if she
  was able to transmit her knowledge in engaging and accessible language. We will
  do our best to follow in her footsteps.
