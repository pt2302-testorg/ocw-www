course_description: 'There are several hundred thousand Brownfield sites across the
  country. The large number of sites, combined with how a majority of these properties
  are located in urban and historically underserved communities, dictate that redevelopment
  of these sites stands to be a common theme in urban planning for the foreseeable
  future. Students form a grounded understanding of the Brownfield lifecycle: how
  and why they were created, their potential role in community revitalization, and
  the general processes governing their redevelopment. Using case studies and guest
  speakers from the public, private and non-profit sectors, students develop and hone
  skills to effectively address the problems posed by these inactive sites.
