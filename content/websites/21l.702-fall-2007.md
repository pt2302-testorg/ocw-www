course_description: "What has been said of _Moby-Dick_\u2014that it's the greatest\
  \ novel no one ever reads\u2014could just as well be said of any number of American\
  \ \"classics\" like _The Scarlet Letter, Uncle Tom's Cabin_, or _The Adventures\
  \ of Huckleberry Finn_. This course reconsiders a small number of nineteenth-century\
  \ American novels by presenting each in a surprising context.\n"
