course_description: 'Where do new drugs and treatments come from? This class will
  take you from the test tubes and mice of the laboratory to the treatment of patients
  with deadly blood disorders. Students will learn how to think as a scientist through
  discussion of primary research papers describing the discoveries of several novel
  treatments. Topics such as gene therapy, the potential of drugs based on RNA interference
  and the reprogramming of somatic cells into stem cells for regenerative medicine
  will be discussed.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
