course_description: 'This subject examines the ways in which we read. It introduces
  some important strategies for engaging with literary texts developed in the twentieth
  century, paying special attention to poststructuralist theories and their legacy.
  The course is organized around specific theoretical paradigms. In general, we will:
  (1) work through the selected readings in order to see how they construe what literary
  interpretation is; (2) locate the limits of each particular approach; and (3) trace
  the emergence of subsequent theoretical paradigms as responses to what came before.
