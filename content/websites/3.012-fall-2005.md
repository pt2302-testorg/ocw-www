course_description: 'This course focuses on the fundamentals of structure, energetics,
  and bonding that underpin materials science. It is the introductory lecture class
  for sophomore students in Materials Science and Engineering, taken with [3.014](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-014-materials-laboratory-fall-2006/)
  and [3.016](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-016-mathematics-for-materials-scientists-and-engineers-fall-2005/)
  to create a unified introduction to the subject. Topics include: an introduction
  to thermodynamic functions and laws governing equilibrium properties, relating macroscopic
  behavior to atomistic and molecular models of materials; the role of electronic
  bonding in determining the energy, structure, and stability of materials; quantum
  mechanical descriptions of interacting electrons and atoms; materials phenomena,
  such as heat capacities, phase transformations, and multiphase equilibria to chemical
  reactions and magnetism; symmetry properties of molecules and solids; structure
  of complex, disordered, and amorphous materials; tensors and constraints on physical
  properties imposed by symmetry; and determination of structure through diffraction.
  Real-world applications include engineered alloys, electronic and magnetic materials,
  ionic and network solids, polymers, and biomaterials.


  This course is a core subject in MIT''s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor).
  This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major
  with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and
  social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.'
