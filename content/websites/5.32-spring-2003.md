course_description: "5.32 involves more advanced experimental work than 5.310 or 5.311.\
  \ The course emphasizes organic synthesis assisted by chiral catalysis, purification,\
  \ and analysis of organic compounds employing such methods as IR, 1D and 2D NMR,\
  \ UV spectroscopies and mass spectrometry, and thin layer and non-chiral and chiral\
  \ gas chromatography.\_In 5.32,\_experiments also involve enzyme purification, characterization\
  \ and assays, as well as molecular modeling in organic synthesis and in biochemical\
  \ systems.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in these materials\
  \ are potentially hazardous and require a high level of safety training, special\
  \ facilities and equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals. You bear\
  \ the sole responsibility, liability, and risk for the implementation of such safety\
  \ procedures and measures. MIT shall have no responsibility, liability, or risk\
  \ for the content or implementation of any of the material presented.  \n  \n[Legal\
