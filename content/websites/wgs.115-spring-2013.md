course_description: 'This course considers a wide range of issues related to the contemporary
  and historical use of technology, the development of new technologies, and the cultural
  representation of technology, including the role women have played in the development
  of technology and the effect of technological change on the roles of women and ideas
  of gender. It discusses the social implications of technology and its understanding
  and deployment in different cultural contexts. It investigates the relationships
  between technology and identity categories, such as gender, race, class, and sexuality,
  and examines how technology offers possibilities for new social relations and how
  to evaluate them.
