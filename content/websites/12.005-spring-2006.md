course_description: 'This course focuses on the practical applications of the continuum
  concept for deformation of solids and fluids, emphasizing force balance. Topics
  include stress tensor, infinitesimal and finite strain, and rotation tensors. Constitutive
  relations applicable to geological materials, including elastic, viscous, brittle,
  and plastic deformation are studied.
