course_description: 'This 6-unit subject gives students the opportunity to immerse
  themselves in the poetry of two living Nobel Laureates: the Caribbean poet, Derek
  Walcott, and the Northern-Irish poet, Seamus Heaney. We will begin and end the semester
  with their magnificent epic works: Heaney''s translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic
  Beowulf, and Walcott''s Omeros (a modern epic set in the West Indies). Between these
  major narrative poems, we will read a rich selection of their shorter poems, as
  well as some of their reflections in prose on what poetry does, on what other poets
  do, and what it means to write in English from the historical and political situation
  of Northern Ireland (for Heaney) or the Caribbean (for Walcott).
