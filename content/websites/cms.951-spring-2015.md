course_description: 'This course focuses on a number of qualitative social science
  methods that can be productively used in media studies research including interviewing,
  participant observation, focus groups, cultural probes, visual sociology, and ethnography.
  The emphasis will primarily be on understanding and learning concrete techniques
  that can be evaluated for their usefulness in any given project and utilized as
  needed. Data organization and analysis will be addressed. Several advanced critical
  thematics will also be covered, including ethics, reciprocity, "studying up," and
  risk. The course will be taught via a combination of lectures, class discussions,
  group exercises, and assignments. This course requires a willingness to work hands-on
  with learning various social science methods and a commitment to the preparation
  for such (including reading, discussion, and reflection).
