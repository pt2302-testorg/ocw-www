course_description: 'This course explores the international trade in television text,
  considering the ways in which ''foreign'' programs find places within ''domestic''
  schedules. Looking at the life television texts maintain outside of their home market,
  this course examines questions of globalization and national cultures of production
  and reception. Students will be introduced to a range of positions about the nature
  of international textual trade, including economic arguments about the structuring
  of international markets and ethnographic studies about the role imported content
  plays in the formation of hybrid national identities. Students will be encouraged
  to consider the role American content is made to play in non-American markets.
