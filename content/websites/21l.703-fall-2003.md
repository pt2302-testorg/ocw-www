course_description: 'Shakespeare "doth bestride the narrow world" of the English Renaissance
  "like a colossus," leaving his contemporaries "walk under his large legs and peep
  about" to find themselves in "dishonourable graves." This course aims in part to
  correct this grave injustice by surveying the extraordinary output of playwrights
  whose names have largely been eclipsed by their more luminous compatriot: Marlowe,
  Jonson, Webster, and Ford, among others. Reading Shakespeare as just one of a group
  of practitioners -- many of whom were more popular than him during and even after
  his remarkable career -- will restore, I hope, a sense not just of the richness
  of English Renaissance drama, but also that of the historical and cultural moment
  of the English Renaissance itself. This course will examine the relationship between
  theatre and society through the lens of the drama produced in response to these
  changes. However, we will not try to map the progress of drama directly onto the
  social world, as if the former can simply read off the latter. Rather, focusing
  on discrete issues and problems, we will try to understand the ways in which a particular
  text not only reflects but responds to and shapes aspects of the culture from which
  it derives, developing an aesthetic that actively engages its world. The topics
  addressed over the course of the semester will be wide-ranging but will include:
  gender and class dynamics in Renaissance society; money, trade, and colonialism;
  the body as metaphor and theatrical "object"; allegory and aesthetic form; theatricality
  and meta-theatricality; the private and the public.
