course_description: '*Principles of Computer System Design: An Introduction* is published
  in two parts. Part I, containing chapters 1-6, is a traditional printed textbook
  published by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of Elsevier. Part II, containing chapters
  7-11, is available here as an open educational resource.


  This textbook, an introduction to the principles and abstractions used in the design
  of computer systems, is an outgrowth of notes written for 6.033 *Computer System
  Engineering* over a period of 40-plus years. Individual chapters are also used in
  other EECS subjects. There is also a [web site for the current 6.033 class](http://mit.edu/6.033)
  with a lecture schedule that includes daily assignments, lecture notes, and lecture
  slides. The 6.033 class Web site also contains a thirteen-year archive of class
  assignments, design projects, and quizzes.'
