course_description: 'This course examines how medicine is practiced cross-culturally,
  with particular emphasis on Western biomedicine. Students analyze medical practice
  as a cultural system, focusing on the human, as opposed to the biological, side
  of things. Also considered is how people in different cultures think of disease,
  health, body, and mind.
