course_description: 'This course provides students with the opportunity to develop
  a map of contemporary architectural practice and discourse. The seminar examines
  six themes in terms of their recent history: city and global economy, urban plan
  and map of operations, program and performance, drawing and scripting, image and
  surface, and utopia and projection. Students will study buildings and read relevant
  texts in order to place recent architectural projects in disciplinary and cultural
  context.
