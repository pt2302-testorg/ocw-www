course_description: 'Can you make a cellphone change the world?


  NextLab is a hands-on year-long design course in which students research, develop
  and deploy mobile technologies for the next billion mobile users in developing countries.
  Guided by real-world needs as observed by local partners, students work in multidisciplinary
  teams on term-long projects, closely collaborating with NGOs and communities at
  the local level, field practitioners, and experts in relevant fields.


  Students are expected to leverage technical ingenuity in both mobile and internet
  technologies together with social insight in order to address social challenges
  in areas such as health, microfinance, entrepreneurship, education, and civic activism.
  Students with technically and socially viable prototypes may obtain funding for
  travel to their target communities, in order to obtain the first-hand feedback necessary
  to prepare their technologies for full fledged deployment into the real world (subject
  to guidelines and limitations).
