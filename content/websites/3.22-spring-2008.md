course_description: 'Here we will learn about the mechanical behavior of structures
  and materials, from the continuum description of properties to the atomistic and
  molecular mechanisms that confer those properties to all materials. We will cover
  elastic and plastic deformation, creep, fracture and fatigue of materials including
  crystalline and amorphous metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and (bio)polymers, and
  will focus on the design and processing of materials from the atomic to the macroscale
  to achieve desired mechanical behavior. We will cover special topics in mechanical
  behavior for material systems of your choice, with reference to current research
  and publications.
