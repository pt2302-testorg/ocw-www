course_description: 'Data structures play a central role in modern computer science.
  You interact with data structures even more often than with algorithms (think Google,
  your mail server, and even your network routers). In addition, data structures are
  essential building blocks in obtaining efficient algorithms. This course covers
  major results and current directions of research in data structure.
