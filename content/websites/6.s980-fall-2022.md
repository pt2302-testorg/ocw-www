course_description: This course covers fundamental and advanced techniques in this
  field at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and geometric deep
  learning. It will lay the foundations of how cameras see the world, how we can represent
  3D scenes for artificial intelligence, how we can learn to reconstruct these representations
  from only a single image, how we can guarantee certain kinds of generalizations,
  and how we can train these models in a self-supervised way.
