course_description: 'Unlike film, theater in America does not have a ratings board
  that censors content. So plays have had more freedom to explore and to transgress
  normative culture. Yet censorship of the theater has been part of American culture
  from the beginning, and continues today. How and why does this happen, and who decides
  whether a play is too dangerous to see or to teach? Are plays dangerous? Sinful?
  Even demonic? In our seminar, we will study plays that have been censored, either
  legally or extra-legally (i.e. refused production, closed down during production,
  denied funding, or taken off school reading lists). We''ll look at laws, both national
  and local, relating to the "obscene", as well as unofficial practices, and think
  about the way censorship operates in American life now. And of course we will study
  the offending texts, themselves, to find what is really dangerous about them, for
  ourselves.
