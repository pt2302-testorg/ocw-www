course_description: 'This course examines European music from the early Middle Ages
  until the end of the Renaissance. It includes a chronological survey and intensive
  study of three topics: chant and its development, music in Italy 1340-1420, and
  music in Elizabethan England. Instruction focuses on methods and pitfalls in studying
  music of the distant past. Students'' papers, problem sets, and presentations explore
  lives, genres, and works in depth. Works are studied in facsimile of original notation,
  and from original manuscripts at MIT, where possible.
