course_description: 'This course is designed to explore the human side of medicine:
  the nature of the physician''s identity and obligations; the history and philosophy
  of the Western medical tradition; the experience of being ill and being a patient;
  and the challenges of medical ethics. The writing in this class is therefore conceived
  as an instrument of exploration, and is an integral part of the class''s activities.
