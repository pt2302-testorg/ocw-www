course_description: '_15.810 Marketing Management_ is designed to serve as an introduction
  to the theory and practice of marketing. Students will improve their ability to
  develop effective marketing strategies and assess market opportunities, as well
  as design strategy implementation programs. In addition, students will have the
  opportunity to communicate and defend their recommendations and build upon the recommendations
  of their peers. We will explore the theory and applications of marketing concepts
  through a mix of cases, discussions, lectures, guest speakers, individual assignments,
  and group projects. We will draw materials from a variety of sources and settings
  including services, consumer and business-to-business products.
