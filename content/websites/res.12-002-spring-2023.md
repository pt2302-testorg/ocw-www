course_description: "At the core of Terrascope is one basic but important idea: MIT\
  \ students, even in their first year, are ready to take control of their own education\
  \ and tackle big, important problems. Every year Terrascope explores a different\
  \ issue, and it\u2019s the students who take command. You will work in teams to\
  \ develop solutions, drawing on diverse perspectives, interdisciplinary research\
  \ and the resources of the Terrascope community. Along the way, you\u2019ll develop\
  \ the real-world skills necessary to address sustainability-related challenges,\
  \ and you will learn about how to organize teams around complex problems of any\
  \ kind.\u200B\n\nIn the fall class, [*Solving Complex Problems*](https://terrascope.mit.edu/portfolio_page/12-000/)*,*\
  \ you will develop solutions and present them to a panel of experts. In the spring\
  \ semester there are two optional classes: [*Design for Complex Environmental Issues*](https://terrascope.mit.edu/portfolio_page/1-016/),\
  \ in which you will design and prototype specific technologies that address aspects\
  \ of the year\u2019s Terrascope challenge; and [*Terrascope Radio*](https://terrascope.mit.edu/portfolio_page/sp-360/),\
  \ in which you will create a radio program to communicate your ideas to the general\
  \ public."
