course_description: 'To study MIT is to study the modern world. In 2016, MIT celebrated
  the 100{{< sup "th" >}} anniversary of the move from Boston to Cambridge; therefore,
  this course examines the history of the Institute through the lens of the history
  of science and technology, and vice-versa. It is about discovery, exploration, adventure,
  learning, creative thinking, and the synthesis of big ideas. Additionally, this
  course is about the importance of the research university, what it has been in the
  past and what it will be in the future. The course includes guest lecturers and
  field trips to the Institute Archives and the MIT Museum.


  The most important prerequisite for this class is curiosity, a desire to think deeply
  about MIT, and a willingness to communicate your thoughts and ideas. The ultimate
  aim is to fascinate you as much as to help you improve your skills synthesizing
  information from diverse sources about science, technology, and culture.
