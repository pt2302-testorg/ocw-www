course_description: 'This course provides a basic overview of the history of women
  in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Students will learn
  about specific contributions of women across a variety of disciplines and will gain
  a broad perspective on how these contributions played a larger role in the advancement
  of human knowledge and technological achievement. The class will also grapple with
  how both historic and modern biases within the STEM disciplines, as well as in representations
  of women and girls in media and popular culture, can affect outcomes in these areas.
