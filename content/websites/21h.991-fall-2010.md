course_description: 'We will doggedly ask two questions in this class: "What is history?"
  and "How do you do it in 2010?" In pursuit of the answers, we will survey a variety
  of approaches to the past used by historians writing in the last several decades.
  We will examine how these historians conceive of their object of study, how they
  use primary sources as a basis for their accounts, how they structure the narrative
  and analytical discussion of their topic, and the advantages and limitations of
  their approaches.
