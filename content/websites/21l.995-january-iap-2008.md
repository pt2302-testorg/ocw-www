course_description: 'In this 3-unit class, we will read Milton''s epic poem _Paradise
  Lost_. The goal of the class is for students to come away feeling comfortable with
  its language and argument; meeting in a small group will also allow us to talk about
  the key questions and issues raised by the poem. This course is offered during the
  Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that
  runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.
