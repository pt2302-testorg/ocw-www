course_description: "Space Systems Engineering (16.83X) is the astronautical capstone\
  \ course option in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\_ Between Spring\
  \ 2002 and Spring 2003, the course was offered in a 3-semester format, using a Conceive,\
  \ Design, Implement and Operate (C-D-I-O) teaching model.\_16.83X is shorthand for\
  \ the three course numbers: 16.83, 16.831, and 16.832.\_The first semester (16.83)\
  \ is the Conceive-Design phase of the project, which results in a detailed system\
  \ design, but precedes assembly.\_ The second semester (16.831) is the Implement\
  \ phase, and involves building the\_students' system.\_ The final semester (16.832)\
  \ is the Operate phase, in which the system is\_tested and readied to\_perform in\
  \ its intended environment.\n\nThis year's project objective was to demonstrate\
  \ the feasibility of an electromagnetically controlled array of formation flying\
  \ satellites.\_ The project, \"EMFFORCE\", was\_an extension of the first C-D-I-O\
  \ course project, \"SPHERES\", which ran from\_Spring 1999 through Spring 2000,\
  \ and demonstrated satellite formation flying using gas thrusters for station-keeping.\_\
  \ The whole class works on the same project,\_but divides\_into smaller subsystem\
  \ teams, such as\_power, metrology, and structures, to handle design details.\n"
