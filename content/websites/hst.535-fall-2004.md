course_description: 'The principles and practice of tissue engineering (and regenerative
  medicine) are taught by faculty of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and
  Technology (HST) and Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. The principles underlying
  strategies for employing selected cells, biomaterial scaffolds, soluble regulators
  or their genes, and mechanical loading and culture conditions, for the regeneration
  of tissues and organs _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ are addressed. Differentiated cell
  types and stem cells are compared and contrasted for this application, as are natural
  and synthetic scaffolds. Methodology for the preparation of cells and scaffolds
  in practice is described. The rationale for employing selected growth factors is
  covered and the techniques for incorporating their genes into the scaffolds are
  examined. Discussion also addresses the influence of environmental factors including
  mechanical loading and culture conditions (e.g., static versus dynamic). Methods
  for fabricating tissue-engineered products and devices for implantation are taught.
  Examples of tissue engineering-based procedures currently employed clinically are
  analyzed as case studies.
