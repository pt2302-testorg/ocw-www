course_description: 'The seminar is designed to look at the science of triathlons
  and sports from a molecular/chemical biological point of view. We will be able to
  use our own bodies to see how exercise affects the system, through observations
  written in a training journal. We will also improve the overall fitness of the class
  through maintaining a physical fitness program over the course of the term. The
  end of the term will have us all participate in a mini-triathlon.
