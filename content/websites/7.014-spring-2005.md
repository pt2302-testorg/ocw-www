course_description: 'The MIT Biology Department core courses, [7.012](courses/7-012-introduction-to-biology-fall-2004),
  [7.013](courses/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2006), and 7.014, all cover the
  same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics,
  molecular biology, and cell biology. Biological function at the molecular level
  is particularly emphasized and covers the structure and regulation of genes, as
  well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated
  into cells, and how these cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms.
  In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.


  7.014 focuses on the application of these fundamental principles, toward an understanding
  of microorganisms as geochemical agents responsible for the evolution and renewal
  of the biosphere and of their role in human health and disease.

  7.014 include contributions from past instructors, teaching assistants, and other
  members of the MIT Biology Department affiliated with course 7.014. Since the following
  works have evolved over a period of many years, no single source can be attributed.
