course_description: 'This course studies the fundamentals of how the design and operation
  of internal combustion engines affect their performance, efficiency, fuel requirements,
  and environmental impact. Topics include fluid flow, thermodynamics, combustion,
  heat transfer and friction phenomena, and fuel properties, with reference to engine
  power, efficiency, and emissions. Students examine the design features and operating
  characteristics of different types of internal combustion engines: spark-ignition,
  diesel, stratified-charge, and mixed-cycle engines. The class includes lab project
  in the Engine Laboratory.
