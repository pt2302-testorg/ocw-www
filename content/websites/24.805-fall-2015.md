course_description: 'This course is a graduate seminar surveying recent work on self-knowledge.
  Some questions that will be explored and discussed are: What is the distinctive
  philosophical interest of self-knowledge? Is self-knowledge really an _epistemic_
  achievement? Is it plausible that there is a uniform explanation of all distinctively
  first-personal self-knowledge?
