course_description: "This semester, we will read writing about travel and place from\
  \ Columbus's _Diario_ through the present. Travel writing has some special features\
  \ that will shape both the content and the work for this subject: reflecting the\
  \ point of view, narrative choices, and style of individuals, it also responds to\
  \ the pressures of a real world only marginally under their control. Whether the\
  \ traveler is a curious tourist, the leader of a national expedition, or a starving,\
  \ half-naked survivor, the encounter with place shapes what travel writing can be.\
  \ Accordingly, we will pay attention not only to narrative texts but to maps, objects,\
  \ archives, and facts of various kinds.\n\nOur materials are organized around three\
  \ regions: North America, Africa and the Atlantic world, the Arctic and Antarctic.\
  \ The historical scope of these readings will allow us to know something not only\
  \ about the experiences and writing strategies of individual travelers, but about\
  \ the progressive integration of these regions into global economic, political,\
  \ and knowledge systems. Whether we are looking at the production of an Inuit film\
  \ for global audiences, or the mapping of a route across the North American continent\
  \ by water, these materials do more than simply record or narrate experiences and\
  \ territories: they also participate in shaping the world and what it means to us.\n\
  \nAuthors will include Olaudah Equiano, Caryl Philips, Claude L\xE9vi-Strauss, Joseph\
  \ Conrad, Jamaica Kincaid, William Least Heat Moon, Louise Erdrich, \xC1lvar N\xFA\
  \xF1ez Cabeza de Vaca.\n\nExpeditions will include those of Lewis and Clark (North\
  \ America), Henry Morton Stanley (Africa), Ernest Shackleton and Robert F. Scott\
  \ (Antarctica).\n"
