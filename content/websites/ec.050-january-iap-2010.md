  of features on the moon, stars, and moons around Jupiter that no one had seen before.
  Recreate these new ways of seeing and exploring from the materials and techniques
  Galileo had on hand, while you reflect on the times and works of Galileo. What was
  it like to improvise new ways of seeing and exploring from the materials and techniques
  on hand? What do we notice? What surprises us? How can we relate to past experience
  and ideas? What are we curious to research? How does our experimenting grow into
  our learning? Let your own curiosity drive your explorations.
