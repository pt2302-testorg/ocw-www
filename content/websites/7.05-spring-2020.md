course_description: 'This course focuses on contributions of biochemistry toward an
  understanding of the structure and functioning of organisms, tissues, and cells.
  Topics include:


  *   Chemistry and functions of constituents of cells and tissues and the chemical
  and physical-chemical basis for the structures of nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates.

  *   Basic enzymology and biochemical reaction mechanisms involved in macromolecular
  synthesis and degradation, signaling, transport, and movement.

  *   General metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and nitrogen-containing materials
  such as amino acids, proteins, and related compounds.


  NOTE: The first half of this course, taught by Prof. Yaffe, is available on the
  MITx platform as _[7.05x Biochemistry: Biomolecules, Methods, and Mechanisms](https://www.edx.org/course/biochemistry-biomolecules-methods-and-mechanisms?utm_source=mitopenlearning-mit-open-learning&utm_medium=affiliate_partner)_.
  This OCW website provides content primarily from the second half with Prof. Vander
  Heiden, which focuses on metabolism.
