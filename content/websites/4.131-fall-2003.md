course_description: 'The theme that unites the Level II studios in the fall semester
  is a focus upon the ''making of architecture and built form'' as a tectonic, technical
  and materially driven endeavor. It is a design investigation that is rooted in a
  larger culture of materiality and the associated phenomena, but a study of the language
  and production of built form as an integrated response to the conceptual proposition
  of the project. The studio will look to works of architecture where the material
  tectonic and its resultant technology or fabrication become instrumental to the
  realization of the ideas, in whatever form they may take. This becomes the ''art
  of technology'' -- suggesting a level of innovation and creative manipulation as
  part of the design process to transform material into a composition of beauty and
  poetry as well as environmental control. In this regard the studio will look to
  the works and design processes of a number of architects including Shigeru Ban,
  Peter Zumthor, Herzog and deMeuron, Kazuyo Sejima, Richard Horden, Rick Joy and
  Glenn Murcutt among others.
