course_description: "This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of biological,\
  \ inorganic, and organic molecules. The emphasis is on basic principles of atomic\
  \ and molecular electronic structure, thermodynamics, acid-base and redox equilibria,\
  \ chemical kinetics, and catalysis. One year of high school chemistry is the expected\
  \ background for this freshman-level course.\n\nThe aims include developing a unified\
  \ and intuitive view of how electronic structure controls the three-dimensional\
  \ shape of molecules, the physical and chemical properties of molecules in gases,\
  \ liquids and solids, and ultimately the assembly of macromolecules as in polymers\
  \ and DNA. Relationships between chemistry and other fundamental sciences such as\
  \ biology and physics are emphasized, as are the relationships between the science\
  \ of chemistry to its applications in environmental science, atmospheric chemistry\
  \ and electronic devices.\_\n\n[![Click to get started.](/images/button_start.png)](pages/syllabus)\n\
  \n### Acknowledgements\n\nProfessor Drennan would like to acknowledge the contributions\
  \ of MIT Lecturer Dr. Elizabeth Vogel Taylor, Professor Sylvia Ceyer, and Professor\
  \ Robert Silbey to the development of this course and its materials.\n"
