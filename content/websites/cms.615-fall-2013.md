course_description: 'Run as a workshop, students collaborate in teams to design and
  prototype games for social change and civic engagement. Through readings, discussion,
  and presentations, we explore principles of game design and the social history of
  games. Guest speakers from academia, industry, the non-profit sector, and the gaming
  community contribute unique and diverse perspectives. Course culminates in an end
  of semester open house to showcase our games.
