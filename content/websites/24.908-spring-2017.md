course_description: 'Caribbean Creole languages result from language contact via colonization
  and the slave trade. In this course we explore the history of Creole languages from
  cognitive, historical and comparative perspectives. We evaluate popular theories
  about "Creole genesis" and the role of language acquisition. Then we explore the
  non-linguistic aspects of Creole formation, using sources from literature, religion
  and music. We also look into issues of Caribbean identities as we examine Creole
  speakers'' and others'' beliefs and attitudes toward their cultures. We also make
  comparisons with relevant aspects of African-American culture in the U.S.
