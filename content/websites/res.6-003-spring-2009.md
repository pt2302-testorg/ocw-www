course_description: 'First published in 1968 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc., _Electromechanical
  Dynamics_ discusses the interaction of electromagnetic fields with media in motion.
  The subject combines classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory and provides
  opportunities to develop physical intuition. The book uses examples that emphasize
  the connections between physical reality and analytical models. Types of electromechanical
  interactions covered include rotating machinery, plasma dynamics, the electromechanics
  of biological systems, and magnetoelasticity.


  An accompanying [solutions manual](/resources/res-6-003-electromechanical-dynamics-spring-2009/solutions-manual)
  for the problems in the text is provided.
