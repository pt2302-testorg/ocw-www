course_description: 'The neuropharmacology course will discuss the drug-induced changes
  in functioning of the nervous system. The specific focus of this course will be
  to provide a description of the cellular and molecular actions of drugs on synaptic
  transmission. This course will also refer to specific diseases of the nervous system
  and their treatment in addition to giving an overview of the techniques used for
  the study of neuropharmacology.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
