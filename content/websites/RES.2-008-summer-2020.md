course_description: "In this course you will learn the three laws of thermodynamics,\
  \ explore concepts like entropy and enthalpy, and investigate the causes and effects\
  \ of global warming from a thermodynamics perspective. We will also apply these\
  \ concepts to learning about state-of-the-art energy conversion and storage technologies,\
  \ for example heat pumps, hydrogen fuel cells, metal-air batteries, artificial photosynthesis,\
  \ molten salt storage, and concentrated solar power.\_\n\nThis course was offered\
  \ as part of [MITES Semester](https://mites.mit.edu/discover-mites/mites-semester/)\
  \ (formerly MOSTEC) in Summer 2022. MITES Semester is a 6-month online program for\
  \ rising high-school seniors. The program offers students an opportunity to learn\
  \ about diverse science and engineering fields, strengthen their academic STEM foundation,\
  \ build 21st-century skills in networking, interviewing, collaboration and presentation\
  \ delivery, prepare for college, and build a strong community of peers and mentors.\n\
  \nMITES Semester is part of [MIT Introduction to Technology, Engineering, and Science\
  \ (MITES)](https://mites.mit.edu/), which provides transformative experiences that\
  \ bolster confidence, create lifelong community, and build an exciting, challenging\
  \ foundation in STEM for highly motivated 7th\u201312th grade students from diverse\
  \ and underrepresented backgrounds."
