course_description: '16.225 is a graduate level course on Computational Mechanics
  of Materials. The primary focus of this course is on the teaching of state-of-the-art
  numerical methods for the analysis of the nonlinear continuum response of materials.
  The range of material behavior considered in this course includes: linear and finite
  deformation elasticity, inelasticity and dynamics. Numerical formulation and algorithms
  include: variational formulation and variational constitutive updates, finite element
  discretization, error estimation, constrained problems, time integration algorithms
  and convergence analysis. There is a strong emphasis on the (parallel) computer
  implementation of algorithms in programming assignments. The application to real
  engineering applications and problems in engineering science is stressed throughout
  the course.
