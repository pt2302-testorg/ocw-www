course_description: "This course is for upper-level graduate students who are planning\
  \ careers in computational neuroscience. This course focuses on the problem of supervised\
  \ learning from the perspective of modern statistical learning theory starting with\
  \ the theory of multivariate function approximation from sparse data. It develops\
  \ basic tools such as Regularization including Support Vector Machines for regression\
  \ and classification. It derives generalization bounds using both stability and\
  \ VC theory. It also discusses topics such as boosting and feature selection and\
  \ examines applications in several areas: Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Text\
  \ Classification, and Bioinformatics. The final projects, hands-on applications,\
  \ and exercises are designed to\_illustrate the rapidly increasing practical uses\
  \ of the techniques described throughout the course.\n"
