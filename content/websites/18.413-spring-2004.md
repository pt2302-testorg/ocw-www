course_description: 'This course introduces students to iterative decoding algorithms
  and the codes to which they are applied, including Turbo Codes, Low-Density Parity-Check
  Codes, and Serially-Concatenated Codes. The course will begin with an introduction
  to the fundamental problems of Coding Theory and their mathematical formulations.
  This will be followed by a study of Belief Propagation--the probabilistic heuristic
  which underlies iterative decoding algorithms. Belief Propagation will then be applied
  to the decoding of Turbo, LDPC, and Serially-Concatenated codes. The technical portion
  of the course will conclude with a study of tools for explaining and predicting
  the behavior of iterative decoding algorithms, including EXIT charts and Density
  Evolution.
