course_description: "6.111 is reputed to be one of the most demanding classes at MIT,\
  \ exhausting many students' time and creativity. The course covers digital design\
  \ topics such as digital logic, sequential building blocks, finite-state machines,\
  \ FPGAs, timing and synchronization. The semester begins with lectures and problem\
  \ sets, to introduce fundamental topics before students embark on lab assignments\
  \ and ultimately, a digital design project. The students design and implement a\
  \ final digital project of their choice, in areas such as games, music, digital\
  \ filters, wireless communications, video, and graphics. The course relies on extensive\
  \ use of Verilog\xAE for describing and implementing digital logic designs on state-of-the-art\
  \ FPGA.\n"
