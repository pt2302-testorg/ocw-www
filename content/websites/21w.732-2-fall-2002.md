course_description: 'An information-based society necessitates good writing in all
  careers.


  Many scientists and technical professionals must write progress reports, analyses,
  literature reviews, or other documents to communicate within their workplaces, and
  many must also address more general audiences in grant proposals, conference papers,
  articles, and so on. This course is designed to serve as a basic introduction to
  the practice of technical writing for those who work as scientists and technical
  researchers.


  Because scientific and technical fields are becoming more interdisciplinary and
  more globally connected everyday, we will also consider intercultural communication
  issues at some length.
