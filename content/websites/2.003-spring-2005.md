course_description: 'This course is the first of a two term sequence in modeling,
  analysis and control of dynamic systems. The various topics covered are as follows:
  mechanical translation, uniaxial rotation, electrical circuits and their coupling
  via levers, gears and electro-mechanical devices, analytical and computational solution
  of linear differential equations, state-determined systems, Laplace transforms,
  transfer functions, frequency response, Bode plots, vibrations, modal analysis,
  open- and closed-loop control, instability, time-domain controller design, and introduction
  to frequency-domain control design techniques. Case studies of engineering applications
  are also covered.
