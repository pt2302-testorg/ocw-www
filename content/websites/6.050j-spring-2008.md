course_description: 'This course explores the ultimate limits to communication and
  computation, with an emphasis on the physical nature of information and information
  processing. Topics include: information and computation, digital signals, codes
  and compression, applications such as biological representations of information,
  logic circuits, computer architectures, and algorithmic information, noise, probability,
  error correction, reversible and irreversible operations, physics of computation,
  and quantum computation. The concept of entropy is applied to channel capacity and
  to the second law of thermodynamics.
