course_description: "This course focuses on the design of control systems. Topics\
  \ covered include:\_frequency domain and state space techniques; control law design\
  \ using Nyquist diagrams and Bode plots; state feedback, state estimation, and the\
  \ design of dynamic control laws;\_and elementary analysis of nonlinearities and\
  \ their impact on control design. There is\_extensive use of computer-aided control\
  \ design tools. Applications to various aerospace systems, including navigation,\
  \ guidance, and control of vehicles, are also discussed.\n"
