course_description: 'MIT students bring rich cultural backgrounds to their college
  experience. This course explores the splits, costs, confusions, insights, and opportunities
  of living in two traditions, perhaps without feeling completely at home in either.
  Course readings include accounts of growing up Asian-American, Hispanic, Native
  American, and South-East Asian-American, and of mixed race. The texts include selections
  from Maxine Hong Kingston''s _The Woman Warrior_, Kesaya E. Noda''s "Growing Up
  Asian in America," Sandra Cisneros''s _Woman Hollering_ _Creek_, Gary Soto''s "Like
  Mexicans," Sherman Alexie''s _The Toughest Indian in the_ _World_, Jhumpa Lahiri''s
  _Interpreter of Maladies_, the movies _Smoke Signals_ and _Mississippi Masala_,
  Danzy Senna''s _Caucasia_, and others. We will also use students'' writings as ways
  to investigate our multiple identities, exploring the constraints and contributions
  of cultural and ethnic traditions. Students need not carry two passports in order
  to enroll; an interest in reading and writing about being shaped by multiple influences
  suffices.
