course_description: "This course introduces students to the modeling, quantification,\
  \ and analysis of uncertainty.\_ The tools of probability theory, and of the related\
  \ field of statistical inference, are the keys for being able to analyze and make\
  \ sense of data. These tools underlie important advances in many fields, from the\
  \ basic sciences to engineering and management.\n##### Course Format\n\n* * *\n\n\
  [![Click to get started.](/images/button_start.png)](pages/syllabus) This course\
  \ has been designed for independent study. It provides everything you will need\
  \ to understand the concepts covered in the course. The materials include:\n\n*\
  \   Lecture Videos by MIT Professor John Tsitsiklis\n*   Lecture Slides and Readings\n\
  *   Recitation Problems and Solutions\n*   Recitation Help Videos by MIT Teaching\
  \ Assistants\n*   Tutorial Problems and Solutions\n*   Tutorial Help Videos by MIT\
  \ Teaching Assistants\n*   Problem Sets with Solutions\n*   Exams with Solutions\n\
  \n##### Related Resource\n\n* * *\n\nA complementary resource,\__[Introduction to\
  \ Probability](/courses/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/)_,\_\
  is provided by the videos developed for an EdX version of 6.041. These videos cover\
  \ more or less the same content, in somewhat different order, and in somewhat more\
  \ detail than the videotaped live lectures."
