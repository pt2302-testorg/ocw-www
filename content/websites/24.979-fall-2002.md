course_description: 'This seminar will investigate the expression of gradability,
  comparison and degree in natural language. The course will address the following
  major issues, though we may also include other topics according to the interests
  and direction of the class:


  *   The underlying semantic representation of expressions of degree and the linguistic
  significance of scalar representations

  *   The logical form of comparative constructions, and the implications of comparatives
  for other aspects of the grammar

  *   The semantics of degree and the role of scalar representations in grammatical
  categories other than gradable adjectives
