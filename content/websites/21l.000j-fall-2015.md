course_description: "This course is designed around analyzing _intimate bonds_ and\
  \ the permutations of _heartbreak_. Through the analysis of a set of relations in\
  \ novels, short stories, poetry, music videos, and live theatre, we will consider\
  \ the transformative states of the lover\u2019s (un)becoming, for how consciousness\
  \ is constituted by bonds yet how the lover transcends crisis in the moment of the\
  \ epiphany that surfaces in love\u2019s very failure; indeed, love itself becomes\
  \ narcissistically yet optimistically illuminating, even in its oppressive hold.\n"
