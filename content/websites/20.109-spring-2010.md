course_description: 'This course introduces experimental biochemical and molecular
  techniques from a quantitative engineering perspective. Experimental design, data
  analysis, and scientific communication form the underpinnings of this subject. Three
  discovery-based experimental modules focus on RNA engineering, protein engineering,
  and cell-biomaterial engineering.
