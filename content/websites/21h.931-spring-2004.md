course_description: 'This course is designed to acquaint students with a variety of
  approaches to the past used by historians writing in the twentieth century. The
  books we read have all made significant contributions to their respective sub-fields
  and have been selected to give as wide a coverage in both field and methodology
  as possible in one semester''s worth of reading. We examine how historians conceive
  of their object of study, how they use primary sources as a basis for their accounts,
  how they structure the narrative and analytic discussion of their topic, and what
  are the advantages and drawbacks of their various approaches.
