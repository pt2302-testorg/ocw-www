course_description: 'This course pairs faculty-mentored student teams with enterprises
  on the front lines of health care delivery in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
  To tackle specific barriers identified by each partnering organization, the course
  is built around custom-designed projects in strategy, business model innovation,
  operations, marketing, and technology. Class sessions include interactive cases,
  practical exercises, and lively conversations with experts, all designed to support
  project work before, during, and after the intensive two-week onsite collaboration
  with entrepreneurs, leaders, staff, and stakeholders in the setting. Course assignments
  include a portfolio of host deliverable, a foundational toolkit designed to support
  each project, and a distillation of learning from the field.
