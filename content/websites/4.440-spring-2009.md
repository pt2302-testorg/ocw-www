course_description: 'This course provides students with a basic knowledge of structural
  analysis and design for buildings, bridges and other structures. The course emphasizes
  the historical development of structural form and the evolution of structural design
  knowledge, from Gothic cathedrals to long span suspension bridges. Students will
  investigate the behavior of structural systems and elements through design exercises,
  case studies, and load testing of models. Students will design structures using
  timber, masonry, steel, and concrete and will gain an appreciation of the importance
  of structural design today, with an emphasis on environmental impact of large scale
  construction.
