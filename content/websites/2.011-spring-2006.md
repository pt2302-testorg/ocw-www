course_description: 'This course is an introduction to the fundamental aspects of
  science and engineering necessary for exploring, observing, and utilizing the oceans.
  Hands-on projects focus on instrumentation in the marine environment and the design
  of ocean observatories for ocean monitoring and exploration. Topics include acoustics,
  sound speed and refraction, sounds generated by ships and marine animals, sonar
  systems and their principles of operation, hydrostatic behavior of floating and
  submerged bodies geared towards ocean vehicle design, stability of ocean vessels,
  and the application of instrumentation and electronics in the marine environment.
  Students work with sensor systems and deploy them in the field to gather and analyze
  real world data.
