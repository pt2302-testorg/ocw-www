course_description: 'This course features a core framework for an interest-based,
  problem-solving approach to technology, logistics and other systems-oriented negotiations.
  A comprehensive approach to dispute resolution in organizations and complex engineered
  systems is also developed. The course builds key interactive skills, including communications
  skills, dealing with difficult people, negotiating over the "rules of game," and
  cross-cultural negotiations. Assignments center on analysis of negotiated interactions
  and assessing dispute resolution systems.
