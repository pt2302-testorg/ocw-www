course_description: "In this class we will examine how the idea of the city has been\
  \ \"translated\" by artists, architects, and other diverse disciplines. We will\
  \ consider how collaborations between artists and architects might provide opportunities\
  \ for rethinking / redesigning urban spaces. The class will look specifically at\
  \ planned cities like Brasilia, Las Vegas, Canberra, and Celebration and compare\
  \ such tabula rasa designs with the redesign of recyclable urban spaces demonstrated\
  \ in projects such as Ground Zero, Barcelona 2004, and Boston's Rose Kennedy Greenway.\
  \ While the course will involve some reading and discussion, coursework will focus\
  \ largely on the students' own projects / interventions that should evolve over\
  \ the course of the semester.\_ Of the two weekly class meetings, one will be a\
  \ group discussion or lecture with the whole class and visiting guests, and the\
  \ other will be an individual meeting\_between the student and\_the instructor to\
  \ discuss\_his or her\_work\_for the class, including the final project.\n"
