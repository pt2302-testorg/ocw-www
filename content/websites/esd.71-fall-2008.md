course_description: 'Engineering systems design must have the flexibility to take
  advantage of new opportunities while avoiding disasters. This subject develops "real
  options" analysis to create design flexibility and measure its value so that it
  can be incorporated into system optimization. It builds on essential concepts of
  system models, decision analysis, and financial concepts. Emphasis is placed on
  calculating value of real options with special attention given to efficient analysis
  and practical applications. The material is organized and presented to deal with
  the contextual reality of technological systems, that substantially distinguishes
  the analysis of real options in engineering systems from that of financial options.
