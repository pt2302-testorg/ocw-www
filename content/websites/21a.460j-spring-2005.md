course_description: 'This course provides an exploration of colonial and postcolonial
  clashes between theories of healing and embodiment in the African world and those
  of western bio-medicine. It examines how Afro-Atlantic religious traditions have
  challenged western conceptions of illness, healing, and the body and have also offered
  alternative notions of morality, rationality, kinship, gender, and sexuality. It
  also analyzes whether contemporary western bio-medical interventions reinforce colonial
  or imperial power in the effort to promote global health in Africa and the African
  diaspora.
