course_description: 'This course is a survey of perceptual and cognitive aspects of
  the psychology of music, with special emphasis on underlying neuronal and neurocomputational
  representations and mechanisms. Basic perceptual dimensions of hearing (pitch, timbre,
  consonance/roughness, loudness, auditory grouping) form salient qualities, contrasts,
  patterns and streams that are used in music to convey melody, harmony, rhythm and
  separate voices. Perceptual, cognitive, and neurophysiological aspects of the temporal
  dimension of music (rhythm, timing, duration, temporal expectation) are explored.
  Special topics include comparative, evolutionary, and developmental psychology of
  music perception, biological vs. cultural influences, Gestaltist vs. associationist
  vs. schema-based theories, comparison of music and speech perception, parallels
  between music cognition and language, music and cortical action, and the neural
  basis of music performance.
