course_description: 'This seminar provides an introduction to scholarship in a growing
  research community: the sociologists and sociologically-inclined organization theorists
  who study issues that relate, at least in a broad sense, to the interdisciplinary
  field of inquiry that is known as "strategy" or "strategic management" research.
  The course is not designed to survey the field of strategy. Rather, the focus is
  on getting a closer understanding of the recent work by sociologists and sociologically-oriented
  organization theorists that investigates central questions in strategic management.
  In particular, we will be concerned with identifying and assessing sociological
  work that aims to shed light on: (a) relative firm performance; (b) the nature of
  competition and market interaction; (c) organizational capabilities; (d) the beginnings
  of industries and firms; (e) the diffusion or transfer of ideas and practices across
  firms; and (f) strategic change.
