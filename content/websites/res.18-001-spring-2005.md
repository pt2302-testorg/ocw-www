course_description: "Published in 1991 by [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/),\
  \ the book is a useful resource for educators and self-learners alike. It is well\
  \ organized, covers single variable and multivariable calculus in depth, and is\
  \ rich with applications.\_\n\nIn addition to the [Textbook](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/pages/textbook/),\
  \ there is also an online [Instructor's Manual](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/pages/instructor-s-manual/)\
  \ and a student [Study Guide](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/pages/study-guide/).\
  \ Prof. Strang has also developed a related series of videos, [Highlights of Calculus](/courses/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/),\
  \ on the basic ideas of calculus.\n\nThe [2010 second edition](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/)\
  \ of the Calculus textbook includes a new chapter on \"Highlights of Calculus\"\
  \ that connects to the video series of the same name.\_ The new chapter has summaries\
  \ and practice questions for all of the videos.\_ It also introduces The Exponential\
  \ Function (e^x) as presented in Prof. Strang's video on this topic."
