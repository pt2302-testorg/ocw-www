course_description: 'This class is one of the core requirements for the Environmental
  Masters of Engineering program, in conjunction with 1.133 Masters of Engineering
  Concepts of Engineering Practice. It is designed to teach about environmental engineering
  through the use of case studies, computer software tools, and seminars from industrial
  experts. Case studies provide the basis for group projects as well as individual
  theses. Recent 1.782 projects include the MMR Superfund site on Cape Cod, appropriate
  wastewater treatment technology for Brazil and Honduras, point-of-use water treatment
  and safe storage procedures for Nepal and Ghana, Brownfields Development in Providence,
  RI, and water resource planning for the island of Cyprus and refugee settlements
  in Thailand. This class spans the entire academic year; students must register for
  the Fall and Spring terms.
