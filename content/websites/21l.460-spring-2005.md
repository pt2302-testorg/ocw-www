course_description: 'The course explores the literary masterworks of three of the
  most celebrated authors of the Middle Ages in their original literary and historical
  contexts. The various themes they take up - the importance of writing in the vernacular;
  the discourse of love as a form of discipline practised upon the self; the personal
  and political aspirations of the self in society; the constitution of ideal forms
  of social organization; the role of religion in the life and works of lay authors
  - transformed the course of much of Western literature for the next five centuries.
  Readings will include the entire _Divine Comedy_, generous selections from the _Decameron_,
  and all of _Troilus and Criseyde_ in the original Middle English, together with
  samplings from the _Troubadour tradition_ and the _dolce stil nuovo._
