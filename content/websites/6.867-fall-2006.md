course_description: '6.867 is an introductory course on machine learning which gives
  an overview of many concepts, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, beginning
  with topics such as classification and linear regression and ending up with more
  recent topics such as boosting, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and
  Bayesian networks. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition
  behind modern machine learning methods as well as a bit more formal understanding
  of how, why, and when they work. The underlying theme in the course is statistical
  inference as it provides the foundation for most of the methods covered.
