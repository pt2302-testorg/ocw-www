course_description: 'This class investigates the theory, method, and form of collage.
  It studies not only the historical precedents for collage and their physical attributes,
  but the psychology and process that plays a part in the making of them. The class
  was broken into three parts, changing scales and methods each time, to introduce
  and study the rigor by which decisions were made in relation to the collage. The
  class was less about the making of art than the study of the processes by which
  art is made.
