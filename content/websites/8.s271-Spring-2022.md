course_description: "This course was designed to educate students about how nuclear\
  \ weapons came into being, the physics of these weapons, how they are structured,\
  \ how they have evolved over the past several decades, efforts to control them and\
  \ limit the threats that they represent, and what the possibilities for the future\
  \ are. Many people in our country and other countries are not aware of what an existential\
  \ threat nuclear weapons represent, and this lack of awareness is an important part\
  \ of the overall threat.\_\n\nThe course was taught by an MIT Iterdisciplinary team\
  \ coordinated by Robert P. Redwine, Professor of Physics Emeritus. \_The full list\
  \ of instructors is listed on the course page."
