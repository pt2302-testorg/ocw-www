course_description: 'This course provides students with the basic analytical and computational
  tools of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for practical applications
  in science engineering, including heat / diffusion, wave, and Poisson equations.
  Analytics emphasize the viewpoint of linear algebra and the analogy with finite
  matrix problems. Numerics focus on finite-difference and finite-element techniques
  to reduce PDEs to matrix problems. The [Julia Language](http://julialang.org) (a
  free, open-source environment) is introduced and used in homework for simple examples.
