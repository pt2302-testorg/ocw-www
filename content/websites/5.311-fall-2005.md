course_description: '5.311 is the first of a three-term laboratory subject sequence
  for chemistry majors. Experimental work emphasizes development of fundamental laboratory
  skills and techniques: volumetric and colorimetric analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance;
  preparation, purification, and characterization of chemical substances; and data
  analysis.
