course_description: 'This course covers the fundamental concepts of structural mechanics
  with applications to marine, civil, and mechanical structures. Topics include analysis
  of small deflections of beams, moderately large deflections of beams, columns, cables,
  and shafts; elastic and plastic buckling of columns, thin walled sections and plates;
  exact and approximate methods; energy methods; principle of virtual work; introduction
  to failure analysis of structures. We will include examples from civil, mechanical,
  offshore, and ship structures such as the collision and grounding of ships.
