course_description: 'This course explores fundamental questions about the causes and
  nature of revolutions by looking at how people overthrow their rulers and establish
  new governments. Considers a set of major political transformations throughout the
  world and across centuries to understand the meaning of revolution and evaluate
  its impact. Examines how revolutionaries have attempted to establish their ideals
  and realize their goals. Asks whether radical upheavals require bloodshed, violence,
  or even terror. Seeks to explain why some revolutions succeed and others fail. Materials
  include the writings of revolutionaries, declarations and constitutions, music,
  films, art, novels, memoirs, and newspapers.
