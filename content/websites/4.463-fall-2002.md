course_description: 'This course addresses advanced topics in structures, exterior
  envelopes and contemporary production technologies. It continues the exploration
  of structural elements and systems; expanding to include more complex determinant,
  indeterminate, long-span and high-rise systems. Some of the topics covered include
  reinforced concrete, steel and engineered wood design, and an introduction to tensile
  systems. The contemporary exterior envelope is discussed with an emphasis on the
  classification of systems, their performance attributes and advanced manufacturing
  technologies. This course is the second of two graduate structures courses, the
  first of which is 4.462. They offer an expanded version of the content presented
  in the undergraduate course, 4.440.
