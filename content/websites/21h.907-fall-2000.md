course_description: 'This seminar examines a number of famous trials in European and
  American history. It considers the salient issues (political, social, cultural)
  of several trials, the ways in which each trial was constructed and covered in public
  discussions at the time, the ways in which legal reasoning and storytelling interacted
  in each trial and in the later retellings of the trial, and the ways in which trials
  serve as both spectacle and a forum for moral and political reasoning. Students
  have an opportunity to study one trial in depth and present their findings to the
  class.
