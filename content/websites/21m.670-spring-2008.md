course_description: 'This course explores the forms, contents, and context of world
  traditions in dance that played a crucial role in shaping American concert dance.
  For example, we will identify dances from an African American vernacular tradition
  that were transferred from the social space to the concert stage. We will explore
  the artistic lives of such American dance artists as Katherine Dunham, Pearl Primus,
  and Alvin Ailey along with Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, George Balanchine, and
  Merce Cunningham as American dance innovators. Of particular importance to our investigation
  will be the construction of gender and autobiography that lie at the heart of concert
  dance practice, and the ways in which these qualities have been choreographed by
  American artists.
