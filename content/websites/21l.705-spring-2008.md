course_description: 'In 1667, John Milton published what he intended both as the crowning
  achievement of a poetic career and a justification of God''s ways to man: an epic
  poem which retold and reimagined the Biblical story of creation, temptation, and
  original sin. Even in a hostile political climate, _Paradise Lost_ was almost immediately
  recognized as a classic, and one fate of a classic is to be rewritten, both by admirers
  and by antagonists. In this seminar, we will read _Paradise Lost_ alongside works
  of 20th century fantasy and science fiction which rethink both Milton''s text and
  its source.


  Students should come to the seminar having read _Paradise Lost_ straight through
  at least once; this can be accomplished by taking the IAP subject, _Reading_ _Paradise
  Lost_ (21L.995), or independently. Twentieth century authors will include C. S.
  Lewis (_Perelandra_, _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_) and Philip Pullman
  (_His Dark Materials_), as well as assorted criticism. Each week, one class meeting
  will focus on Milton, and the other on one of the modern novels.
