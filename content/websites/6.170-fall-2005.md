course_description: 'This course introduces concepts and techniques relevant to the
  production of large software systems. Students are taught a programming method based
  on the recognition and description of useful abstractions. Topics include modularity,
  specification, data abstraction, object modeling, design patterns, and testing.
  Students complete several programming projects of varying size, working individually
  and in groups.


  Students are now introduced to software engineering in _6.005 Elements of Software
  Construction_, which is available on OCW in two versions, as taught in [Fall 2008](/courses/6-005-elements-of-software-construction-fall-2008/)
  and Fall 2011.
