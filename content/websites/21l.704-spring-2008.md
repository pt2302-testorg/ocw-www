course_description: 'William Butler Yeats occupies a dominant position in the lives
  and work of the Irish poets who followed him. We will explore some of that poetry,
  and consider how later poets, especially female poets, tried to come to grips with,
  or escape from, that dominance. As a seminar, the subject will place special emphasis
  on student involvement and control. I will ask you to submit one ten-twelve page
  essay, two shorter (five page) essays, and to accept the role of "leadoff person,"
  perhaps more than once, That role will demand that you choose from among the assigned
  readings for that session the poem we should focus upon, and to offer either a provocative
  articulation of what the poem is about, or a provocative question which the poem
  confronts, and which we should grapple with, as well.
