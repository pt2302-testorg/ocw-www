course_description: 'This class introduces design as a computational enterprise in
  which rules are developed to compose and describe architectural and other designs.
  The class covers topics such as shapes, shape arithmetic, symmetry, spatial relations,
  shape computations, and shape grammars. It focuses on the application of shape grammars
  in creative design, and teaches shape grammar fundamentals through in-class, hands-on
  exercises with abstract shape grammars. The class discusses issues related to practical
  applications of shape grammars.
