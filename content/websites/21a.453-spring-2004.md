course_description: 'This course examines traditional performances of the Arabic-speaking
  populations of the Middle East and North Africa. Starting with the history of the
  ways in which the West has discovered, translated and written about the Orient,
  we will consider how power and politics play roles in the production of culture,
  narrative and performance. This approach assumes that performance, verbal art, and
  oral literature lend themselves to spontaneous adaptation and to oblique expression
  of ideas and opinions whose utterance would otherwise be censorable or disruptive.
  In particular we will be concerned with the way traditional performance practices
  are affected by and respond to the consequences of modernization.


  Topics include oral epic performance, sacred narrative, Koranic chant performance,
  the folktale, solo performance, cultural production and resistance.
