course_description: "This course links clean energy sources and storage technology\
  \ to energy consumption case studies to give students a concept of the full circle\
  \ of production and consumption. Specifically, photovoltaic, organic photovoltaic,\
  \ piezoelectricity and thermoelectricity sources are applied to electrophoresis,\
  \ lab on a chip, and paper microfluidic applications\u2013relevant analytical techniques\
  \ in biology and chemistry. Hands-on experimentation with everyday materials and\
  \ equipment help connect the theory with the implementation. Complementary laboratories\
  \ fabricating LEDs, organic LEDs and spectrometers introduce the diagnostic tools\
  \ used to characterize energy efficiency.\n\nThis course is one of many [OCW Energy\
  \ Courses](/courses/energy-courses/), and it is an elective subject in MIT\u2019\
  s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/).\
  \ This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major\
  \ with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and\
  \ social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n"
