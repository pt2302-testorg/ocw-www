course_description: "An introduction to several fundamental ideas in electrical engineering\
  \ and computer science, using digital communication systems as the vehicle. The\
  \ three parts of the course\u2014bits, signals, and packets\u2014cover three corresponding\
  \ layers of abstraction that form the basis of communication systems like the Internet.\n\
  \nThe course teaches ideas that are useful in other parts of EECS: abstraction,\
  \ probabilistic analysis, superposition, time and frequency-domain representations,\
  \ system design principles and trade-offs, and centralized and distributed algorithms.\
  \ The course emphasizes connections between theoretical concepts and practice using\
  \ programming tasks and some experiments with real-world communication channels.\n"
