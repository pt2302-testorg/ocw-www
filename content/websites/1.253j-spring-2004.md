  and the environment. It investigates the role of government regulation, green business
  and transportation policy as facilitators of economic development and environmental
  sustainability. It analyzes a variety of international policy problems including
  government-business relations; the role of interest groups, non-governmental organizations,
  and the public and media in the regulation of the automobile; sustainable development;
  global warming; the politics of risk and siting of transport facilities; environmental
  justice; equity; and transportation and public health in the urban metropolis. It
  provides students with an opportunity to apply transportation and planning methods
  to developing policy alternatives in the context of environmental politics.
