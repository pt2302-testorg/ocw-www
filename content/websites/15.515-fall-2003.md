course_description: 'Our goal is to help you develop a framework for understanding
  financial, managerial, and tax reports. The course goal is divided into five subordinate
  challenges that can help you organize the way you learn accounting:


  1.  The record keeping and reporting challenge

  2.  The computation challenge

  3.  The judgment challenge

  4.  The usage challenge

  5.  The search challenge


  The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the
  relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events generating them.
  Restricted to first-year Sloan MBA students.
