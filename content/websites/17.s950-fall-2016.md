course_description: 'The wars in Iraq and Syria have changed the course of international
  relations in the 21st century. During these conflicts, hundreds of thousands have
  died and millions have been displaced. After 13 years, these conflicts continue
  with no end in sight. The central question of this course is: How do political science
  theories and methods help us understand the course of these wars? In this course,
  you will answer this question by integrating three elements: theory, data/description,
  and application of theory to data/description. The primary goal of this course is
  to bolster students'' skills in using various social science methods to explain
  important variations in violent conflict.
