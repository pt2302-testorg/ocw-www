course_description: 'This course covers the design, construction, and testing of field
  robotic systems, through team projects with each student responsible for a specific
  subsystem. Projects focus on electronics, instrumentation, and machine elements.
  Design for operation in uncertain conditions is a focus point, with ocean waves
  and marine structures as a central theme. Topics include basic statistics, linear
  systems, Fourier transforms, random processes, spectra, ethics in engineering practice,
  and extreme events with applications in design.
