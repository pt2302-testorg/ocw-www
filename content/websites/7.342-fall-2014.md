course_description: 'Glycans, which are complex assemblies of sugars, are the most
  prevalent class of macromolecules, surpassing nucleic acids, proteins and lipids.
  Glycans are essential for life, as they are a required energy source, provide protection
  against cellular stresses and shape cellular structure. During this course, we will
  explore the many roles glycans play in human health and disease. For example, we
  will learn about the healthy glycosylation patterns of many mammalian proteins and
  the dynamic changes that glycan structures undergo during early development and
  cancer metastasis, the influence of dietary carbohydrates on glycan metabolism,
  and the role of densely glycosylated proteins involved in HIV infectivity. Concurrently,
  we will learn about the chemical and biological techniques used to detect and visualize
  glycans by in vitro and whole-animal metabolic labeling approaches, how to profile
  protein-glycan interactions using high-throughput glycan arrays, and about the development
  of new carbohydrate-based therapeutics and vaccines to target HIV, influenza and
  bacterial pathogens. The course will focus on the primary research literature, and
  we will learn practical laboratory techniques, experimental design and how to interpret
  data and critique the conclusions offered by authors.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
