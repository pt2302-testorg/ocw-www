course_description: 'This class presents the application of principles of soil mechanics.
  It considers the following topics: the origin and nature of soils; soil classification;
  the effective stress principle; hydraulic conductivity and seepage; stress-strain-strength
  behavior of cohesionless and cohesive soils and application to lateral earth stresses;
  bearing capacity and slope stability; consolidation theory and settlement analysis;
  and laboratory and field methods for evaluation of soil properties in design practice.
