course_description: "In this class, we will examine cholesterol's role in the cell\
  \ and in the body as a whole, from its function as a structural component of the\
  \ membrane to its function in signaling. We will discuss mechanisms of cholesterol\
  \ sensing, mechanisms of feedback regulation in cells, cholesterol in the brain,\
  \ cholesterol in the circulation, 'good cholesterol' and 'bad cholesterol,' cholesterol-related\
  \ human disorders, and the drugs that deal with some of these disorders.\n\nThis\
  \ course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\_\
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the\_Advanced Undergraduate Seminars\_are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
