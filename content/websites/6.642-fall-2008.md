course_description: 'This course focuses on laws, approximations and relations of
  continuum electromechanics. Topics include mechanical and electromechanical transfer
  relations, statics and dynamics of electromechanical systems having a static equilibrium,
  electromechanical flows, and field coupling with thermal and molecular diffusion.
  Also covered are electrokinetics, streaming interactions, application to materials
  processing, magnetohydrodynamic and electrohydrodynamic pumps and generators, ferrohydrodynamics,
  physiochemical systems, heat transfer, continuum feedback control, electron beam
  devices, and plasma dynamics.
