course_description: 'In this exploratory seminar, first-year undergraduate students
  learn the basic physics of nuclear energy and radiation, and learn to communicate
  their knowledge and perspective by writing a traditional Op-Ed piece. The technical
  content emphasizes the unique attributes and challenges of nuclear energy as a low-carbon
  solution as well as the peaceful applications of ionizing radiation to help humankind.
  The open-ended writing project combines personal creativity and technical knowledge
  to share important messages about science. The course employs blended learning,
  as students use the [online course 22.011x](http://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+22.011x+3T2018/about),
  freely available on the [MIT Open Learning Library](http://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),
  to learn the technical content, and meet together in person for the communication
  component, developing and polishing their Op-Eds.
