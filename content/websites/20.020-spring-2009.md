course_description: 'This class is a project-based introduction to the engineering
  of synthetic biological systems. Throughout the term, students develop projects
  that are responsive to real-world problems of their choosing, and whose solutions
  depend on biological technologies. Lectures, discussions, and studio exercises will
  introduce (1) components and control of prokaryotic and eukaryotic behavior, (2)
  DNA synthesis, standards, and abstraction in biological engineering, and (3) issues
  of human practice, including biological safety; security; ownership, sharing, and
  innovation; and ethics. Enrollment preference is given to freshmen.


  This subject was originally developed and first taught in Spring 2008 by Drew Endy
  and Natalie Kuldell. Many of Drew''s materials are used in this Spring 2009 version,
  and are included with his permission.
