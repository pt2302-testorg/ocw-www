course_description: 'Analysis I (18.100) in its various versions covers fundamentals
  of mathematical analysis: continuity, differentiability, some form of the Riemann
  integral, sequences and series of numbers and functions, uniform convergence with
  applications to interchange of limit operations, some point-set topology, including
  some work in Euclidean n-space.


  MIT students may choose to take one of three versions of 18.100: Option A (18.100A)
  chooses less abstract definitions and proofs, and gives applications where possible.
  Option B (18.100B) is more demanding and for students with more mathematical maturity;
  it places more emphasis from the beginning on point-set topology and n-space, whereas
  Option A is concerned primarily with analysis on the real line, saving for the last
  weeks work in 2-space (the plane) and its point-set topology. Option C (18.100C)
  is a 15-unit variant of Option B, with further instruction and practice in written
  and oral communication.
