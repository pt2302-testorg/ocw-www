course_description: 'Coups, civil wars, revolutions, and peaceful transitions are
  the "real stuff" of political science. They show us why politics matters, and they
  highlight the consequences of political choices in times of institutional crisis.
  This course will help you understand why democracies emerge and why they die, from
  ancient times to the recent wave of democratization in Southern Europe, Eastern
  Europe, and the developing world.


  Few things are more dramatic than the collapse of a political system, whether through
  violent conflict or the peaceful negotiation of new political institutions. Explaining
  why regimes break down, why new ones emerge, and how these new regimes are consolidated
  are among the most important questions in political science. Not surprisingly, regime
  change has obsessed scholars for centuries, from Aristotle to Machiavelli to Marx
  to current theorists of democratization.


  You will review several broad explanations for regime change before turning to more
  detailed examination of some of history''s most famous and theoretically interesting
  political transitions: the collapse of the Weimar Republic in Germany; democratic
  breakdown, the consolidation of military dictatorship, and re-democratization in
  Chile; the breakdown of British colonial rule in the Massachussets Bay Colony; and
  protracted political transition in Mexico. There will be shorter discussions of
  democratization in Spain, South Africa, and South Korea; as well as democratic collapse
  in Brazil, Austria, and Italy.
