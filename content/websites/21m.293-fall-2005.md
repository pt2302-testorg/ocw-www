course_description: 'This course is an introduction to selected musical traditions
  of West Africa. A variety of musical practices and their cultural contexts will
  be explored through listening, reading, and written assignments, with an emphasis
  on class discussion. The course includes in-class instruction in West African drumming,
  song and dance, as well as lecture-demonstrations by guest artists.


  After an introductory unit, the course will be organized around four main geographical
  areas: Senegal, Mali, Ghana, and Nigeria. An in-depth study of music from these
  countries will be interspersed with brief overviews of Southern, Central, and East
  Africa.
