course_description: '_1.011 Project Evaluation_ covers methodologies for evaluating
  civil engineering projects, which typically are large-scale and long-lived and involve
  many economic, financial, social and environmental factors. The course places an
  emphasis on dealing with uncertainty. Students learn basic techniques of engineering
  economics, including net present value analysis, life-cycle costing, benefit-cost
  analysis, and other approaches to project evaluation. Examples are drawn from both
  contemporary and historical projects in various fields, including transportation
  systems, urban development, energy and environmental projects, water resource management,
  telecommunications systems, and other elements of the public and private projects
  and programs.
