course_description: 'This course presents a top-down approach to communications system
  design. The course will cover communication theory, algorithms and implementation
  architectures for essential blocks in modern physical-layer communication systems
  (coders and decoders, filters, multi-tone modulation, synchronization sub-systems).
  The course is hands-on, with a project component serving as a vehicle for study
  of different communication techniques, architectures and implementations. This year,
  the project is focused on WLAN transceivers. At the end of the course, students
  will have gone through the complete WLAN System-On-a-Chip design process, from communication
  theory, through algorithm and architecture all the way to the synthesized standard-cell
  RTL chip representation.
