course_description: '15.875 is a project-based course that explores how organizations
  can use system dynamics to achieve important goals. In small groups, students learn
  modeling and consulting skills by working on a term-long project with real-life
  managers. A diverse set of businesses and organizations sponsor class projects,
  from start-ups to the Fortune 500. The course focuses on gaining practical insight
  from the system dynamics process, and appeals to people interested in system dynamics,
  consulting, or managerial policy-making.
