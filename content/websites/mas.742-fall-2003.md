course_description: "This class investigates cognitive science and technology as it\
  \ is applied to the industrial design process. The class introduces prototyping\
  \ techniques and approaches for objective evaluation as part of the design process.\
  \ Students practice evaluating products with mechanical and electronic aspects.\
  \ Evaluation processes are applied to creating functioning smart product prototypes.\
  \ This is a project oriented subject that draws upon engineering, aesthetic, and\
  \ creative skills.\_It is geared toward students interested in creating physical\
  \ products which encompass electronics and computers, aimed at including them in\
  \ smart scenarios. Students in the class will present readings, learn prototyping\
  \ skills, create a product prototype, and complete a publication style paper.\n"
