course_description: 'Planning Economics will apply microeconomic theory to issues
  that markets don''t always handle well and so are not usually covered in a standard
  microeconomics course. Issues for this year include global warming, how you value
  a national park, the economics and politics of New York City development, how cities
  form and why people are willing to pay more to live in, say, the Boston Metro area,
  than they would pay to live in rural North Dakota, and how to evaluate costs and
  benefits that occur at different points in time.
