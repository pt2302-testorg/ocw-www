course_description: "Negotiation and Conflict Management presents negotiation theory\
  \ \u2013 strategies and styles \u2013 within an employment context. 15.667 meets\
  \ only eleven times, with a different topic each week, which is why students should\
  \ commit to attending all classes. In addition to the theory and exercises presented\
  \ in class, students practice negotiating with role-playing simulations that cover\
  \ a range of topics. Students also learn how to negotiate in difficult situations,\
  \ which include abrasiveness, racism, sexism, whistle-blowing, and emergencies.\
  \ The course covers conflict management as a first party and as a third party: third-party\
  \ skills include helping others deal directly with their conflicts, mediation, investigation,\
  \ arbitration, and helping the system change as a result of a dispute.\n\nLearning\
  \ and grading in 15.667 is based on: readings, simulations and class discussions,\
  \ four self-assessments, your analysis of the negotiations of others, writing each\
  \ week in your journal, and writing three Little Papers.\n"
