course_description: 'Designed to familiarize students with theories and analytical
  tools useful for studying research literature, this course is a survey of fluid
  mechanical problems in the water environment. Because of the inherent nonlinearities
  in the governing equations, we shall emphasize the art of making analytical approximations
  not only for facilitating calculations but also for gaining deeper physical insight.
  The importance of scales will be discussed throughout the course in lectures and
  homeworks. Mathematical techniques beyond the usual preparation of first-year graduate
  students will be introduced as a part of the course. Topics vary from year to year.
