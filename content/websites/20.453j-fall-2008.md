course_description: 'This course teaches the design of contemporary information systems
  for biological and medical data. Examples are chosen from biology and medicine to
  illustrate complete life cycle information systems, beginning with data acquisition,
  following to data storage and finally to retrieval and analysis. Design of appropriate
  databases, client-server strategies, data interchange protocols, and computational
  modeling architectures. Students are expected to have some familiarity with scientific
  application software and a basic understanding of at least one contemporary programming
  language (e.g. C, C++, Java, Lisp, Perl, Python). A major term project is required
  of all students. This subject is open to motivated seniors having a strong interest
  in biomedical engineering and information system design with the ability to carry
  out a significant independent project.


  This course was offered as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma)
  (SMA) program as course number SMA 5304.
