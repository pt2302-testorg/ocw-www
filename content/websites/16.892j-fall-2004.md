course_description: 'Space System Architecture and Design incorporates lectures, readings
  and discussion on topics in the architecting of space systems. The class reviews
  existing space system architectures and the classical methods of designing them.
  Sessions focus on multi-attribute utility theory as a new design paradigm for space
  systems, when combined with integrated concurrent engineering and efficient searches
  of large architectural tradespaces. Designing for flexibility and uncertainty is
  considered, as are policy and product development issues.
