course_description: 'This course covers organizational, strategic and operational
  aspects of managing Supply Networks (SNs) from domestic and international perspectives.
  Topics include alternative SN structures, strategic alliances, design of delivery
  systems and the role of third party logistics providers. Many of the activities
  exchanged among enterprises in a SN are of a service nature, and the final output
  is often a combination of tangible products and services which the end-customer
  purchases. A series of concepts, frameworks and analytic tools are provided to better
  understand the management of service operations. Guest speakers share their experiences
  in managing SNs and services. Restricted to MIT Sloan Fellows in Innovation and
  Global Leadership.
