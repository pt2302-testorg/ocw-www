course_description: 'Design, operation, and management of traffic flows over complex
  transportation networks are the foci of this course. It covers two major topics:
  traffic flow modeling and traffic flow operations. Sub-topics include deterministic
  and probabilistic models, elements of queuing theory, and traffic assignment. Concepts
  are illustrated through various applications and case studies. This is a half-term
  subject offered during the second half of the semester.
