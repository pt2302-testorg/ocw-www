course_description: "The aim of the students from the Numeric Photography class at\
  \ the MIT Media Laboratory was to present an exhibition of digital artworks which\
  \ blend photography and computation, in the context of scene capture, image play,\
  \ and interaction. Equipped with low end digital cameras, students created weekly\
  \ software projects to explore aesthetic issues in signal processing and interaction\
  \ design. The results are more than a hundred Java\xAE applets, many of which are\
  \ interactive, that suggest new avenues for image play on the computer. These weekly\
  \ exercises led to the final product, an exhibition of the student work.\n"
