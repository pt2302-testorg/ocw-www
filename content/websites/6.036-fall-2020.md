course_description: "This course introduces principles, algorithms, and applications\
  \ of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction. It includes\
  \ formulation of learning problems and concepts of representation, over-fitting,\
  \ and generalization. These concepts are exercised in supervised learning and reinforcement\
  \ learning, with applications to images and to temporal sequences.\n\nThis course\
  \ is part of the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use.\_You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling.\n"
