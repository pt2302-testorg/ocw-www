course_description: 'Co-evolution and adaptation between viruses and humans are often
  portrayed as a zero-sum biological arms race. Viruses enter host cells equipped
  with an array of mechanisms to evade the host defense responses and replicate. The
  rapid rate of mutation of viruses permits evolution of various methodologies for
  infection, which in turn drive development of non-specific but highly effective
  host mechanisms to restrict infection. This class will discuss the varied solutions
  each side has developed as a means for survival. We will use examples drawn from
  human disease-causing pathogens that contribute seriously to the global health burden,
  including HIV, influenza and dengue virus. Primary research papers will be discussed
  to help students learn to pose scientific questions and design and conduct experiments
  to answer the questions and critically interpret data.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
