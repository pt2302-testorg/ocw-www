course_description: 'This course surveys the core perceptual and cognitive abilities
  of the human mind and asks how they are implemented in the brain. Key themes include
  the representations, development, and degree of functional specificity of these
  components of mind and brain. The course will take students straight to the cutting
  edge of the field, empowering them to understand and critically evaluate empirical
  articles in the current literature.
