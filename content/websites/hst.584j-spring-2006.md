course_description: 'This course is an introduction to basic NMR theory. Examples
  of biochemical data obtained using NMR are summarized along with other related experiments.
  Students participate in detailed study of NMR imaging techniques, including discussions
  of basic cross-sectional image reconstruction, image contrast, flow and real-time
  imaging, and hardware design considerations. Exposure to laboratory NMR spectroscopic
  and imaging equipment is included.
