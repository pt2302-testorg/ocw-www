course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the technology and policy
  context of public communications networks, through critical discussion of current
  issues in communications policy and their historical roots. The course focuses on
  underlying rationales and models for government involvement and the complex dynamics
  introduced by co-evolving technologies, industry structure, and public policy objectives.
  Cases drawn from cellular, fixed-line, and Internet applications include evolution
  of spectrum policy and current proposals for reform; the migration to broadband
  and implications for universal service policies; and property rights associated
  with digital content. The course lays a foundation for thesis research in this domain.
