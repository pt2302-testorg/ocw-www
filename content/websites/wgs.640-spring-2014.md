course_description: 'Using film and related popular media as our texts, this course
  will examine how screen "embodiments" of the woman visualize ideologies of discipline
  and desire in a culture in which her body has become a representation of the ability
  to control appetites, size and shape while investing personal and social capital
  in its rehabilitation as a project of endless reconstruction, redesign and maintenance.
  Throughout the course we will draw from feminist film theory, clinical psychology,
  as well as women''s, gender, and cultural studies, to better understand how filmic
  representations of the woman''s body first emerge from contemporary psychosocial
  contexts and then in turn shape the body ideals and internalizations, as well as
  the behavioral practices of the film spectator.
