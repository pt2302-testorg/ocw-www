course_description: "This capstone course is a group design project involving integration\
  \ of nuclear physics, particle transport, control, heat transfer, safety, instrumentation,\
  \ materials, environmental impact, and economic optimization. It provides opportunities\
  \ to synthesize knowledge acquired in nuclear and non-nuclear subjects and apply\
  \ this knowledge to practical problems of current interest in nuclear applications\
  \ design. Each year, the class takes on a different design project; this year, the\
  \ project is a power plant design that ties together the creation of emission-free\
  \ electricity with carbon sequestration and fossil fuel displacement. Students taking\
  \ graduate version complete additional assignments.\n\nThis course is an elective\
  \ subject in MIT\u2019s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/).\
  \ This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major\
  \ with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and\
  \ social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n"
