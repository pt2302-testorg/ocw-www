course_description: 'This course examines representations of race, class, gender,
  and sexual identity in the media, with a particular focus on new media and how digital
  technologies are transforming popular culture. We will be considering issues of
  authorship, spectatorship, (audience) and the ways in which various media content
  (film, television, print journalism, blogs, video, advertising) enables, facilitates,
  and challenges these social constructions in society.
