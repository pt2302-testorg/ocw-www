course_description: 'MIT students are challenged daily to solve for x, to complete
  four problem sets, two papers, and prepare for an exam worth 30% of their grade...
  all in one night. When they do stop to breathe, it''s for a shower or a meal. What
  does this have to do with creative writing? Everything. Creative writing and MIT
  go together better than you might imagine.
