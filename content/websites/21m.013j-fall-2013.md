course_description: 'This course explores the relationship between music and the supernatural,
  focusing on the social history and context of supernatural beliefs as reflected
  in key literary and musical works from 1600 to the present. It provides an understanding
  of the place of ambiguity and the role of interpretation in culture, science and
  art. Great works of art by Shakespeare, Verdi, Goethe (in translation), Gounod,
  Henry James and Benjamin Britten are explored, as well as readings from the most
  recent scholarship on magic and the supernatural.
