course_description: 'This course examines the economic, political, social, and spatial
  dynamics of urban growth and decline in cities and their key component areas (downtown,
  suburbs, etc.). Topics include impacts of industrialization, technology, politics,
  and social practices on cities. Students will examine the role of public and private
  sector activities, ranging from zoning and subsidies to infrastructure development
  and real estate investment, in affecting urban growth and decline. Readings are
  both theoretical and empirical, with considerable thought paid to comparative and
  historical differences.
