course_description: 'Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cancer involves
  uncontrolled cell growth, resistance to cell death, failure to differentiate into
  a particular cell type, and increased cellular motility. A family of gate-keeper
  genes, known as tumor suppressor genes, plays important roles in preventing the
  initiation and progression of cancer. Among these, p53 is the most famous. Because
  of its essential role in maintaining genomic integrity, p53 is often called the
  guardian of the genome. During this course, we will study how p53 serves as a pivotal
  tumor suppressor gene in preventing cancer.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
