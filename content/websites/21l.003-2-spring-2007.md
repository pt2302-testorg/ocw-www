course_description: 'Reading Fiction is designed to sharpen your skills as a critical
  reader. As we explore both short stories and novels focusing on the theme of "the
  city in literature," we will learn about the various elements that shape the way
  we read texts - structure, narrative voice, character development, novelistic experimentation,
  historical and political contexts and reader response.
