  \ discussion as appropriate to the specific topic. This course also satisfies the\
  \ training grant requirements of the NIH for education in the responsible conduct\
  \ of research.\n\nBeginning in Spring 2004, this course will be titled \"Survival\
  \ Skills for Researchers: The Responsible Conduct of Research.\"\n"
