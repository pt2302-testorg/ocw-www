course_description: "The mission of the MIT-Haiti Initiative is to promote active\
  \ learning in Krey\xF2l so that Haitians can have universal access to quality education\
  \ in the language that most of them speak at home.\_\n\n[Platf\xF2m MIT-Ayiti](http://mit-ayiti.net/),\
  \ launched in 2019,\_offers a wealth of freely accessible educational resources\
  \ in Krey\xF2l, including downloadable lesson plans and picture books categorized\
  \ by topic, alongside official curricula from Haiti's Ministry of National Education.\
  \ The target audience for these resources includes students at all levels from pre-kindergarten\
  \ through high school, and we offer materials in all disciplines. We also host and\
  \ invite contributions from all educators who are willing to submit their own materials\
  \ in Krey\xF2l. We work with these contributions, in *konbit* (collaborative)\_\
  mode, to improve these submissions before publication. *Men anpil, chay pa lou!*\_\
  (That is, many hands make light work!)\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s original\_[website](http://haiti.mit.edu/),\
  \ launched in 2010,\_includes software tools for math, physics, genetics, and biochemistry\
  \ education, as well as a preliminary (work-in-progress) glossary of Krey\xF2l equivalents\
  \ for English words commonly used in the STEM disciplines."
