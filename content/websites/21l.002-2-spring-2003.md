course_description: "This subject offers a broad survey of texts (both literary and\
  \ philosophical) drawn from the Western tradition and selected to trace the growth\
  \ of ideas about the nature of mankind's ethical and political life in the West\
  \ since the renaissance. It will deal with the change in perspective imposed by\
  \ scientific ideas, the general loss of a supernatural or religious perspective\
  \ upon human events, and the effects for good or ill of the increasing authority\
  \ of\_an intelligence uninformed by religion as a guide to life.\_The readings are\
  \ roughly complementary to the readings in 21L001, and classroom discussion will\
  \ stress appreciation and analysis of texts that came to represent the cultural\
  \ heritage of the modern world.\n"
