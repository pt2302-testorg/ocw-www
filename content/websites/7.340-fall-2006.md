course_description: 'In this class we will learn about how the process of DNA replication
  is regulated throughout the cell cycle and what happens when DNA replication goes
  awry. How does the cell know when and where to begin replicating its DNA? How does
  a cell prevent its DNA from being replicated more than once? How does damaged DNA
  cause the cell to arrest DNA replication until that damage has been repaired? And
  how is the duplication of the genome coordinated with other essential processes?
  We will examine both classical and current papers from the scientific literature
  to provide answers to these questions and to gain insights into how biologists have
  approached such problems.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
