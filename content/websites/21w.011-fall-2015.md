course_description: 'This course seeks to provide a supportive context for students
  to grow significantly as writers by discovering and engaging with issues that matter
  to them. Writing on social and ethical issues, we can see ourselves within a tradition
  of authors such as Charles Dickens, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
  George Orwell, Rachel Carson, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., who have
  used the power of the pen to inspire social change.
