course_description: "Complex analysis is a basic tool with a great many practical\
  \ applications to the solution of physical problems. It revolves around complex\
  \ analytic functions\u2014functions that have a complex derivative. Unlike calculus\
  \ using real variables, the mere existence of a complex derivative has strong implications\
  \ for the properties of the function. Applications reviewed in this class include\
  \ harmonic functions, two dimensional fluid flow, easy methods for computing (seemingly)\
  \ hard integrals, Laplace transforms, and Fourier transforms with applications to\
  \ engineering and physics.\n"
