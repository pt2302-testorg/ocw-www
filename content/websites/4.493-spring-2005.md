course_description: 'This course will focus on providing students with the tools needed
  to practice responsible architecture in a contemporary context. It will familiarize
  students with the materials currently used in responsible practice, as well as the
  material properties most relevant to assembly. The course will also introduce students
  to materials that are untested but hold promise for future usage. Finally, the course
  will challenge students to refine their understanding of responsible or sustainable
  design practice by looking at the evolution of those ideas within the field of architecture.
