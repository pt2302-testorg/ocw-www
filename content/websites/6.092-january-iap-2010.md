course_description: "This course is an introduction to software engineering, using\
  \ the Java\u2122 programming language. It covers concepts useful to 6.005. Students\
  \ will learn the fundamentals of Java. The focus is on developing high quality,\
  \ working software that solves real problems.\n\nThe course is designed for students\
  \ with some programming experience, but if you have none and are motivated you will\
  \ do fine. Students who have taken 6.005 should not take this course. Each class\
  \ is composed of one hour of lecture and one hour of assisted lab work.\n\nThis\
  \ course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special\
  \ 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the\
  \ month.\n"
