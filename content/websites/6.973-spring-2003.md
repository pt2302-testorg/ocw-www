course_description: 'The course examines optical and electronic processes in organic
  molecules and polymers that govern the behavior of practical organic optoelectronic
  devices. Electronic structure of a single organic molecule is used as a guide to
  the electronic behavior of organic aggregate structures. Emphasis is placed on the
  use of organic thin films in active organic devices including organic LEDs, solar
  cells, photodetectors, transistors, chemical sensors, memory cells, electrochromic
  devices, as well as xerography and organic non-linear optics. How to reach the ultimate
  miniaturization limit of molecular electronics and related nanoscale patterning
  techniques of organic materials will also be discussed. The class encompasses three
  laboratory sessions during which the students will practice the use of select vacuum
  and non-vacuum organic deposition techniques by making their own active organic
  devices.
