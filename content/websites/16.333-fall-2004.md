course_description: 'This class includes a brief review of applied aerodynamics and
  modern approaches in aircraft stability and control. Topics covered include static
  stability and trim; stability derivatives and characteristic longitudinal and lateral-directional
  motions; and physical effects of the wing, fuselage, and tail on aircraft motion.
  Control methods and systems are discussed, with emphasis on flight vehicle stabilization
  by classical and modern control techniques; time and frequency domain analysis of
  control system performance; and human-pilot models and pilot-in-the-loop controls
  with applications. Other topics covered include V/STOL stability, dynamics, and
  control during transition from hover to forward flight; parameter sensitivity; and
  handling quality analysis of aircraft through variable flight conditions. There
  will be a brief discussion of motion at high angles-of-attack, roll coupling, and
  other nonlinear flight regimes.
