course_description: 'In 16.540 we address fluid dynamic phenomena of interest in internal
  flow situations. The emphasis tends to be on problems that arise in air breathing
  propulsion, but the application of the concepts covered is more general, and the
  course is wider in scope, than turbomachines (in spite of the title). Stated more
  directly, the focus is on the fluid mechanic principles that determine the behavior
  of a broad class of industrial devices. The material can therefore be characterized,
  only partly tongue in cheek, as "industrial strength fluid mechanics done in a rigorous
  manner".
