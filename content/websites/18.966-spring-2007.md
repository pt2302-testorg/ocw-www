course_description: 'This is a second-semester graduate course on the geometry of
  manifolds. The main emphasis is on the geometry of symplectic manifolds, but the
  material also includes long digressions into complex geometry and the geometry of
  4-manifolds, with special emphasis on topological considerations.
