course_description: 'This course introduces undergraduates to the basic theory, institutional
  architecture, and practice of international development. We take an applied, interdisciplinary
  approach to some of the "big questions" in our field. This course will unpack these
  questions by providing an overview of existing knowledge and best practices in the
  field. The goal of this class is to go beyond traditional dichotomies and narrow
  definitions of progress, well-being, and culture. Instead, we will invite students
  to develop a more nuanced understanding of international development by offering
  an innovative set of tools and content flexibility.
