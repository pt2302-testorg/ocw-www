course_description: 'This class covers molecular-level engineering and analysis of
  chemical processes. The use of chemical bonding, reactivity, and other key concepts
  in the design and tailoring of organic systems are discussed in this class. Specific
  class topics include application and development of structure-property relationships,
  and descriptions of the chemical forces and structural factors that govern supramolecular
  and interfacial phenomena for molecular and polymeric systems.
