course_description: "\"The Art of the Probable\" addresses the history of scientific\
  \ ideas, in particular the emergence and development of mathematical probability.\
  \ But it is neither meant to be a history of the exact sciences _per se_ nor an\
  \ annex to, say, the Course 6 curriculum in probability and statistics. Rather,\
  \ our objective is to focus on the formal, thematic, and rhetorical features that\
  \ imaginative literature shares with texts in the history of probability. These\
  \ shared issues include (but are not limited to): the attempt to quantify or otherwise\
  \ explain the presence of chance, risk, and contingency in everyday life; the deduction\
  \ of causes for phenomena that are knowable only in their effects; and, above all,\
  \ the question of what it means to think and act rationally in an uncertain world.\n\
  \nOur course therefore aims to broaden students' appreciation for and understanding\
  \ of how literature interacts with \u2013 both reflecting upon and contributing\
  \ to \u2013 the scientific understanding of the world. We are just as centrally\
  \ committed to encouraging students to regard imaginative literature as a unique\
  \ contribution to knowledge in its own right, and to see literary works of art as\
  \ objects that demand and richly repay close critical analysis. It is our hope that\
  \ the course will serve students well if they elect to pursue further work in Literature\
  \ or other discipline in SHASS, and also enrich or complement their understanding\
  \ of probability and statistics in other scientific and engineering subjects they\
  \ elect to take.\n"
