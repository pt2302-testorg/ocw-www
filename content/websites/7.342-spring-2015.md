course_description: 'One of the major priorities in biomedical research is understanding
  the molecular events that establish the complex processes involved in human development
  and the relationships of these processes to human disease and disease progression.
  In this class, we will explore stem cell biology and the way in which it has developed
  and shaped our ability to study complex human disease. We will introduce the field
  of stem cell biology and genome engineering through critical reading of both the
  classical and newest primary research literature. In addition, this course will
  discuss specific disease model systems and their benefits / limitations for understanding
  the disease and treating human patients.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
