course_description: 'This subject explores the legal history of the United States
  as a gendered system. It examines how women have shaped the meanings of American
  citizenship through pursuit of political rights such as suffrage, jury duty, and
  military service, how those political struggles have varied for across race, religion,
  and class, as well as how the legal system has shaped gender relations for both
  women and men through regulation of such issues as marriage, divorce, work, reproduction,
  and the family. The course readings will draw from primary and secondary materials
  in American history, as well as some court cases. However, the focus of the class
  is on the broader relationship between law and society, and no technical legal knowledge
  is required or assumed.
