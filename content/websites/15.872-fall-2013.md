course_description: 'Continuation of _15.871_, emphasizing tools and methods needed
  to apply systems thinking and simulation modeling successfully in complex real-world
  settings. Uses simulation models, management flight simulators, and case studies
  to deepen the conceptual and modeling skills introduced in _15.871_. Through models
  and case studies of successful applications students learn how to use qualitative
  and quantitative data to formulate and test models, and how to work effectively
  with senior executives to implement change successfully.
