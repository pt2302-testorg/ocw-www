course_description: 'This course analyzes the development of the United States Congress
  by focusing on the competing theoretical lenses through which legislatures have
  been studied. In particular, it compares sociological and economic models of legislative
  behavior, applying those models to floor decision-making, committee behavior, political
  parties, relations with other branches of the Federal government, and elections.
  Graduate students are expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through reading
  and individual research.
