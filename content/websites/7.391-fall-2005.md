course_description: 'Do you like teaching, but find yourself frustrated by how little
  students seem to learn? Would you like to try teaching, but are nervous about whether
  you will be any good at it? Are you interested in new research on science education?
  Research in science education shows that the greatest obstacle to student learning
  is the failure to identify and confront the misconceptions with which the students
  enter the class or those that they acquire during their studies. This weekly seminar
  course focuses on developing the participants'' ability to uncover and confront
  student misconceptions and to foster student understanding and retention of key
  concepts. Participants read primary literature on science education, uncover basic
  concepts often overlooked when teaching biology, and lead a small weekly discussion
  session for students currently enrolled in introductory biology classes.


  The instructor for this course, Dr. Julia Khodor, is a member of the [HHMI Education
  Group](http://educationgroup.mit.edu/HHMIEducationGroup/).
