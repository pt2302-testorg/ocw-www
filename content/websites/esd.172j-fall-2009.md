course_description: 'In 2004, the Ansari X PRIZE for suborbital spaceflight captured
  the public''s imagination and revolutionized an industry, leveraging a $10M prize
  purse into over $100M in innovation. Building from that success, the X PRIZE Foundation
  is now developing new prizes to focus innovation around "Grand Challenge" themes,
  including genomics, energy, healthcare, and education.


  This course will examine the intersection of incentives and innovation, drawing
  on economic models, historic examples, and recent experience of the X PRIZE Foundation
  to help develop a future prize in Energy Storage Technologies.
