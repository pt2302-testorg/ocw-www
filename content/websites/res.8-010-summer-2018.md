course_description: "*Introduction to Statistical Physics* introduces the concepts\
  \ and formalism at the foundations of statistical physics. By the end of the course,\
  \ students should understand qualitative and quantitative definitions of entropy,\
  \ the implications of the laws of thermodynamics, and why the Boltzmann distribution\
  \ is important in modeling systems at finite temperature. In terms of skills, students\
  \ should have increased their familiarity with mathematical methods in the physical\
  \ science, learned how to write short programs to simulate random events, and become\
  \ more adept at articulating their understanding of physics.\n\nThis course was\
  \ offered as part of [MITES Summer](https://mites.mit.edu/discover-mites/mites-summer/),\
  \ a six-week, residential STEM experience for rising high school seniors. [MIT Introduction\
  \ to Technology, Engineering, and Science (MITES)](https://mites.mit.edu/) provides\
  \ transformative experiences that bolster confidence, create lifelong community,\
  \ and build an exciting, challenging foundation in STEM for highly motivated 7th\u2013\
  12th grade students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds."
