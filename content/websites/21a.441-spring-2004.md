course_description: 'In this course the conquest and colonization of the Americas
  is considered, with special attention to the struggles of native peoples in Guatemala,
  Canada, Brazil, Panama, and colonial New England. In two segments of the course-one
  devoted to the Jesuit missionization of the Huron in the 1630s, the other to struggles
  between the government of Panama and the Kuna between 1900 and 1925-students examine
  primary documents such as letters, reports, and court records, to draw their own
  conclusions. Attention focuses on how we know about and represent past eras and
  other peoples, as well as on the history of struggles between native Americans and
  Europeans.
