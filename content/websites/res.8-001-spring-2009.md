course_description: "L\xE1szl\xF3 Tisza was [Professor of Physics Emeritus at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/obit-tisza-0416.html),\
  \ where he began teaching in 1941. This online publication is a reproduction the\
  \ original lecture notes for the course \"Applied Geometric Algebra\" taught by\
  \ Professor Tisza in the Spring of 1976.\n\nOver the last 100 years, the mathematical\
  \ tools employed by physicists have expanded considerably, from differential calculus,\
  \ vector algebra and geometry, to advanced linear algebra, tensors, Hilbert space,\
  \ spinors, Group theory and many others. These sophisticated tools provide powerful\
  \ machinery for describing the physical world, however, their physical interpretation\
  \ is often not intuitive. These course notes represent Prof. Tisza's attempt at\
  \ bringing conceptual clarity and unity to the application and interpretation of\
  \ these advanced mathematical tools. In particular, there is an emphasis on the\
  \ unifying role that Group theory plays in classical, relativistic, and quantum\
  \ physics. Prof. Tisza revisits many elementary problems with an advanced treatment\
  \ in order to help develop the geometrical intuition for the algebraic machinery\
  \ that may carry over to more advanced problems.\n\nThe lecture notes came to MIT\
  \ OpenCourseWare by way of Samuel Gasster, '77 (Course 18), who had taken the course\
  \ and kept a copy of the lecture notes for his own reference. He dedicated dozens\
  \ of hours of his own time to convert the typewritten notes into LaTeX files and\
  \ then publication-ready PDFs. You can read about his motivation for wanting to\
  \ see these notes published in his Preface. Professor Tisza kindly gave his permission\
  \ to make these notes available on MIT OpenCourseWare.\n"
