course_description: 'This is the first of a two-semester subject sequence that provides
  the foundations for contemporary research in selected areas of atomic and optical
  physics. Topics covered include the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance;
  absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom
  formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple
  atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity
  violations, Bell''s inequalities; and experimental methods.
