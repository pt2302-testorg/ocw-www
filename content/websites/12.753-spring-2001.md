course_description: 'The Earth''s crust is primarily composed of melting products
  from mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges - both presently and over the course of
  Earth history. While both systems represent upwelling features in a convective mantle,
  they can be viewed as end-member systems in that plumes represent buoyant flow whereas
  mid-ocean ridges represent passive corner flow. This paradigm is not strict - flow
  beneath ridges may be buoyant in some places, for example, but it does provide a
  reasonable framework for enquiry.


  Plumes and ridges can be studied independently, but in many places across the globe
  the systems interact, often in intriguing fashion. The nature of these interactions
  provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of both systems, and provides
  new perspectives on the mantle, crustal, and water column processes associated converting
  heat from the Earth''s interior into new crust, hydrothermal flow, and biological
  communities on the seafloor.


  The approach taken for the 2001 Plume-Ridge Interactions Seminar series was to start
  with basic ideas about mantle convection and tectonics, and an overview of the global
  hotspot and ridge systems. We then addressed three case studies of plume-ridge interactions
  in detail. Our first case was the interaction of the. Each of these systems provides
  a different perspective on the nature of plume-ridge interactions, and by comparison
  and contrast we are able to distill the fundamental aspects out of the complex array
  of geophysical and geochemical data associated with plume-ridge systems.
