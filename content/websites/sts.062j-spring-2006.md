course_description: "This class examines the relationship between a number of mind-altering\
  \ substances and cultural processes. We look at the relationship between drugs and\
  \ such phenomena as poverty, religion, technology, inter-generational conflict,\
  \ colonialism, and global capitalism. We read about the physiological and psychological\
  \ effects of these substances -- ranging from alcohol to LSD, cocaine and ecstasy\
  \ -- and ask why different societies prohibit and sanction different drugs. We examine\
  \ the use of mind-altering substances in a number of \"traditional\" societies,\
  \ and follow the development of a global trade in such substances as sugar, coffee,\
  \ tea, nicotine, cocaine, and marijuana concurrent with the evolution of global\
  \ capitalism. We look at the use of LSD as a mind-control substance by the CIA and\
  \ as a mind-altering substance in the 1960's counter-culture, and we look at the\
  \ rise of Prozac\xAE and Viagra\xAE as popular, if controversial, pharmaceutical\
  \ products in recent years. Finally, we evaluate America's current drug laws.\n"
