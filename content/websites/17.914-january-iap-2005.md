course_description: "This workshop is designed to introduce students to different\
  \ perspectives on politics and the state of the world through new visualization\
  \ techniques and approaches to interactive political gaming (and selective 'edutainment').\
  \ Specifically, we shall explore applications of\_interactive tools (such as video\_\
  and web-based games, blogs or simulations) to examine critical challenges in international\
  \ politics of the 21C century focusing specifically on general insights and specific\
  \ understandings generated by operational uses of\_core concepts in political science.\n"
