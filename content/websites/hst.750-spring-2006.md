course_description: 'This course explores the theory and practice of scientific modeling
  in the context of auditory and speech biophysics. Based on seminar-style discussions
  of the research literature, the class draws on examples from hearing and speech,
  and explores general, meta-theoretical issues that transcend the particular subject
  matter. Examples include: What is a model? What is the process of model building?
  What are the different approaches to modeling? What is the relationship between
  theory and experiment? How are models tested? What constitutes a good model?
