course_description: 'This course covers theories about the form that settlements should
  take and attempts a distinction between descriptive and normative theory by examining
  examples of various theories of city form over time. Case studies will highlight
  the origins of the modern city and theories about its emerging form, including the
  transformation of the nineteenth-century city and its organization. Through examples
  and historical context, current issues of city form in relation to city-making,
  social structure, and physical design will also be discussed and analyzed.
