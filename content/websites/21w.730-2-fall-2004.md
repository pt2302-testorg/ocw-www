course_description: "\"Creative activity (isn't) the icing on the cake. Human creativity\
  \ is the cake.\" (Jerry Hirschberg)\n\nCreativity - \"the mastery of information\
  \ and skills in the service of dreams\" (Hirschberg) -\_is much prized in the arts,\
  \ science, business and the classroom. What does the creative process look like?\
  \ Under what conditions does it flourish - what ignites the creative spark? Attempting\
  \ to answer these questions, this class explores ways creativity has been understood\
  \ in Western culture: what we prize and fear about creativity and its wellsprings;\
  \ how writers, artists, scientists and inventors have described their own creative\
  \ processes; how psychologists and philosophers have theorized it; ways in which\
  \ creativity has been represented in Western culture, particularly in 20th century\
  \ films; and creativity in everyday life, including our own lives. Readings include\
  \ portions of psychologist Rollo May's _The Courage To Create_, and essays by Joan\
  \ Didion, John Updike, Alice Walker, Oliver Sacks, and others. In addition, we'll\
  \ watch video profiles of choreographer Paul Taylor, architect Maya Lin, and jazz\
  \ musician Dave Brubeck. We'll keep journals in which we note our own observations\
  \ and reflections on creative process. We will also watch a film together as a class\
  \ one evening early in the term.\n"
