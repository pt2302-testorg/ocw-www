course_description: 'This course teaches techniques for the design and analysis of
  efficient algorithms, emphasizing methods useful in practice. Topics covered include:
  sorting; search trees, heaps, and hashing; divide-and-conquer; dynamic programming;
  amortized analysis; graph algorithms; shortest paths; network flow; computational
  geometry; number-theoretic algorithms; polynomial and matrix calculations; caching;
  and parallel computing.


  This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)
  (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5503 (Analysis and Design of Algorithms).
