course_description: 'Do poems think? Recurrent images of the poet as an inspired lunatic,
  and of poetry as a fundamentally irrational art, have often fostered an understanding
  of poets and their work as generally extraneous to the work of the sciences. Yet
  poets have long reflected upon and have sought to embody in their work the most
  elementary processes of mind, and have frequently drawn for these representations
  on the very sciences to which they are thought to stand - and sometimes do genuinely
  stand - in opposition. Far from representing a mere departure from reason, then,
  the poem offers an image of the mind at work, an account of how minds work, a tool
  for eliciting thought in the reader or auditor. Bringing together readings in British
  poetry of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with writings from the emergent
  sciences of psychology and the physiology of the brain, this interdisciplinary course
  will explore the ways in which British poets, in years that witnessed the crucial
  development of these sciences, sought to capture an image of the mind at work. The
  primary aim of the course is to examine how several prominent genres of British
  poetry - the lyric, for instance, and the didactic poem - draw from and engage in
  this period with accounts of cognition within the sciences of psychology, physiology,
  and medicine. More broadly, the course aims to give undergraduates with some prior
  experience in the methods and topics of literary study an introduction to interdisciplinary
  humanistic research.
