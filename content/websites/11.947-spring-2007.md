course_description: 'This class examines the history and theory of historic preservation,
  focusing on the United States, but with reference to traditions and practices in
  other countries. The class is designed to examine the largely untold history of
  the historic preservation movement in this country, and explore how laws, public
  policies and cultural attitudes shape how we preserve or do not preserve the built
  environment. The class will give students a grounding in the history, theory and
  practice of historic preservation, but is not an applied, technical course.
