course_description: "This course covers a variety of topics concerning superconducting\
  \ magnets, including thermodynamic and transport properties of aqueous and nonaqueous\
  \ electrolytes, the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the kinetics of electrode\
  \ processes. It also covers electrochemical characterization with regards to d.c.\
  \ techniques (controlled potential, controlled current) and\_a.c. techniques (voltametry\
  \ and impedance spectroscopy). Applications of the following will also be discussed:\
  \ electrowinning, electrorefining, electroplating, and electrosynthesis, as well\
  \ as electrochemical power sources (batteries and fuel cells).\n"
