course_description: '9.63 teaches principles of experimental methods in human perception
  and cognition, including design and statistical analysis. The course combines lectures
  and hands-on experimental exercises and requires an independent experimental project.
  Some experience in programming is desirable. To foster improved writing and presentation
  skills in conducting and critiquing research in cognitive science, students are
  required to provide reports and give oral presentations of three team experiments.
  A fourth individually conducted experiment includes a proposal with revision, and
  concluding written and oral reports.
