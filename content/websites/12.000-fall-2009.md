course_description: "_12.000_ _Solving Complex Problems_ is designed to provide students\
  \ the opportunity to work as part of a team to propose solutions to a complex problem\
  \ that requires an interdisciplinary approach. For the students of the class of\
  \ 2013, 12.000 will revolve around the issues associated with what we can and must\
  \ do about the steadily increasing amounts CO{{< sub \"2\" >}} in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\
  \n12.000 is a core course for the [MIT Terrascope](https://terrascope.mit.edu/)\
  \ freshman learning community. Each year's class explores a different problem in\
  \ detail through the study of complementary case histories and the development of\
  \ creative solution strategies. It includes training in Web site development, effective\
  \ written and oral communication, and team building. Initially developed with major\
  \ financial support from the [d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in Education](http://web.mit.edu/darbeloff/),\
  \ 12.000 is designed to enhance the freshman experience by helping students develop\
  \ contexts for other subjects in the sciences and humanities, and by helping them\
  \ to establish learning communities that include upperclassmen, faculty, MIT alumni,\
  \ and professionals in science and engineering fields.\n"
