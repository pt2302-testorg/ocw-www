course_description: 'This course provides a broad theoretical basis for system identification,
  estimation, and learning. Students will study least squares estimation and its convergence
  properties, Kalman filters, noise dynamics and system representation, function approximation
  theory, neural nets, radial basis functions, wavelets, Volterra expansions, informative
  data sets, persistent excitation, asymptotic variance, central limit theorems, model
  structure selection, system order estimate, maximum likelihood, unbiased estimates,
  Cramer-Rao lower bound, Kullback-Leibler information distance, Akaike''s information
  criterion, experiment design, and model validation.
