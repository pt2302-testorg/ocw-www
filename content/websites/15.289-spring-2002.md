course_description: "Your success as an academic will depend heavily on your ability\
  \ to communicate to fellow researchers in your discipline, to colleagues in your\
  \ department and university, to undergraduate and graduate students, and perhaps\
  \ even to the public at large. Communicating well in an academic setting depends\
  \ not only on following the basic rules that govern all good communication (for\
  \ example, tailoring the message to meet the needs of a specific audience), but\
  \ also on adhering to the particular norms of academic genres.\n\nThe purpose of\
  \ this course, then, is threefold. First, the course will acquaint you with guidelines\
  \ that will help you create well-crafted academic communication. Second, it will\
  \ give you the opportunity to practice your communication skills and to receive\
  \ extensive feedback from your colleagues and from me.\_You will write and/or revise\
  \ an article manuscript or conference paper, present a conference paper or job talk,\
  \ write a manuscript peer review, and engage in various other communication exercises.\
  \ The article and talk, which are the major assignments of the course, will be based\
  \ on material from your own doctoral studies. Third, the course will provide an\
  \ opportunity for you to learn about professional norms for a range of activities\
  \ that surround the academic enterprise, including, for example, the scholarly publication\
  \ process and the job search process.\n"
