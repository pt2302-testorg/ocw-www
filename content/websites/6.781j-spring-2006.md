course_description: 'This course surveys techniques to fabricate and analyze submicron
  and nanometer structures, with applications. Optical and electron microscopy is
  reviewed. Additional topics that are covered include: surface characterization,
  preparation, and measurement techniques, resist technology, optical projection,
  interferometric, X-ray, ion, and electron lithography; Aqueous, ion, and plasma
  etching techniques; lift-off and electroplating; and ion implantation. Applications
  in microelectronics, microphotonics, information storage, and nanotechnology will
  also be explored.
