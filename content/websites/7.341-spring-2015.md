course_description: 'This course will act as an introduction to the latest developments
  in the fields of cancer biology and immunotherapy. Almost everyone knows someone
  whose life has been affected by cancer. Why is cancer such a difficult disease to
  treat? What is the best system to model the development of a human tumor? How can
  new treatment modalities, especially immune-based therapies that harness the natural
  ability of immune cells to kill target cells, be developed to treat cancer? These
  and other questions will be addressed in this course. We will explore the concepts
  of mouse models for human cancer, humanized cancer mice and cancer immunotherapy
  by reading recent and classic research articles.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
