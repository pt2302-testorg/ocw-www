course_description: "This course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting.\n\nThis seminar provides\
  \ a deeper understanding of the post-translational mechanisms evolved by eukaryotic\
  \ cells to target proteins for degradation. Students learn how proteins are recognized\
  \ and degraded by specific machinery (the proteasome) through their previous tagging\
  \ with another small protein, ubiquitin. Additional topics include principles of\
  \ ubiquitin-proteasome function, its control of the most important cellular pathways,\
  \ and the implication of this system in different human diseases. Finally, speculation\
  \ on the novel techniques that arose from an increased knowledge of the ubiquitin-proteosome\
  \ system and current applications in the design of new pharmacological agents to\
  \ battle disease is also covered.\n"
