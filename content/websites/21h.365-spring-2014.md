course_description: This seminar considers "difference" and "sameness" as they have
  been conceived, experienced, and regulated by peoples of the Middle East, with a
  focus on the 19th and 20th centuries. The first half discusses the Ottoman Empire
  by exploring how this multiethnic, polyglot empire survived for several relatively
  peaceful centuries and what happened when its formula for existence was challenged
  by politics based on mono-ethnic states. The second half of the course focuses on
  post-Ottoman nation-states, such as Turkey and Egypt, and Western-mandated Arab
  states, such as Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq. Finally, the course concludes
  with a case analysis of Israel.
