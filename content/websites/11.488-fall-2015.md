course_description: 'Economic, religious, gender, and ethnic differences must be negotiated
  every day in the urban arena. When tensions and conflict escalate into violence,
  the urban space becomes the battlespace in which these tensions are negotiated.
  This course examines urban development challenges in conflict cities through multiple
  disciplinary perspectives on urban conflict. This course also reviews literature
  that focuses on when violence and cities intersect. Students will learn about policy
  innovations, and study potential planning, design, and policy solutions.
