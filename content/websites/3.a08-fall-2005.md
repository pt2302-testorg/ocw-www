course_description: 'This Freshman Advising Seminar surveys the many applications
  of magnets and magnetism. To the Chinese and Greeks of ancient times, the attractive
  and repulsive forces between magnets must have seemed magical indeed. Through the
  ages, miraculous curative powers have been attributed to magnets, and magnets have
  been used by illusionists to produce "magical" effects. Magnets guided ships in
  the Age of Exploration and generated the electrical industry in the 19th century.
  Today they store information and entertainment on disks and tapes, and produce sound
  in speakers, images on TV screens, rotation in motors, and levitation in high-speed
  trains. Students visit various MIT projects related to magnets (including superconducting
  electromagnets) and read about and discuss the history, legends, pseudoscience,
  science, and technology of types of magnets, including applications in medicine.
  Several short written reports and at least one oral presentation will be required
  of each participant.
