course_description: 'The course is designed to provide a better understanding of the
  built environment, globalization, the current financial crisis and the impact of
  these factors on the rapidly changing and evolving international architecture, engineering,
  construction fields.


  We will, hopefully, obtain a better understanding of how these forces of globalization
  and the current financial crisis are having an impact on the built environment and
  how they will affect firms and your future career opportunities. We will also identify,
  review and discuss best practices and lessons that can be learned from recent events.


  We will explore the "international built environment" in detail, examining how it
  functions and asking what are the managerial, entrepreneurial and professional opportunities,
  challenges and risks in it, especially growing crossover and multi-disciplinary
  opportunities; and we will seek to understand what makes this "built environment"
  so different from other sectors.
