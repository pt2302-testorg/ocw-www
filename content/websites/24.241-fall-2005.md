course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the aims and techniques
  of formal logic. Logic is the science of correct argument, and our study of logic
  will aim to understand what makes a correct argument good, that is, what is it about
  the structure of a correct argument that guarantees that, if the premises are all
  true, the conclusion will be true as well? Our subject (though, to be sure, we can
  only scratch the surface) will be truth and proof, and the connection between them.
