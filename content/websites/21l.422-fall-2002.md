course_description: "\"Tragedy\" is a name originally applied to a particular kind\
  \ of dramatic art and subsequently to other literary forms; it has also been applied\
  \ to particular events, often implying thereby a particular view of life. Throughout\
  \ the history of Western literature it has sustained this double reference. Uniquely\
  \ and insistently, the realm of the tragic encompasses both literature and life.\n\
  \nThrough careful, critical reading of literary texts, this subject will examine\
  \ three aspects of the tragic experience:\_\_\_\_\n\n1.  the scapegoat\n2.  the\
  \ tragic hero\n3.  the ethical crisis\n\nThese aspects of the tragic will be pursued\
  \ in readings that range in the reference of their materials from the warfare of\
  \ the ancient world to the experience of the modern extermination camps.\n"
