course_description: 'This is a discussion-based interactive seminar on the two major
  issues that affect Sub-Saharan Africa: HIV/AIDS and Poverty. AIDS and Poverty, seemingly
  different concepts, are more inter-related to each other in Africa than in any other
  continent. As MIT students, we feel it is important to engage ourselves in a dynamic
  discussion on the relation between the two - how to fight one and how to solve the
  other.
