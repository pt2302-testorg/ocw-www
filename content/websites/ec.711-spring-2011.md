course_description: "D-Lab: Energy offers a hands-on, project-based approach that\
  \ engages students in understanding and addressing the applications of small-scale,\
  \ sustainable energy technology in developing countries where compact, robust, low-cost\
  \ systems for generating power are required. Projects may include micro-hydro, solar,\
  \ or wind turbine generators along with theoretical analysis, design, prototype\
  \ construction, evaluation and implementation. Students will have the opportunity\
  \ both to travel to Nicaragua during spring break to identify and implement projects.\n\
  \nD-Lab: Energy is part of MIT's [D-Lab program](http://d-lab.mit.edu/), which fosters\
  \ the development of appropriate technologies and sustainable solutions within the\
  \ framework of international development.\n\nThis course is an elective subject\
  \ in MIT\u2019s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/).\
  \ This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major\
  \ with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and\
  \ social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n"
