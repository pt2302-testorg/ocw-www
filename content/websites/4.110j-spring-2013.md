course_description: 'This course explores the reciprocal relationships among design,
  science, and technology by covering a wide range of topics including industrial
  design, architecture, visualization and perception, design computation, material
  ecology, and environmental design and sustainability. Students will examine how
  transformations in science and technology have influenced design thinking and vice
  versa, as well as develop methodologies for design research and collaborate on design
  solutions to interdisciplinary problems.
