course_description: 'This subject provides an introduction to fluid mechanics. Students
  are introduced to and become familiar with all relevant physical properties and
  fundamental laws governing the behavior of fluids and learn how to solve a variety
  of problems of interest to civil and environmental engineers. While there is a chance
  to put skills from calculus and differential equations to use in this subject, the
  emphasis is on physical understanding of why a fluid behaves the way it does. The
  aim is to make the students think as a fluid. In addition to relating a working
  knowledge of fluid mechanics, the subject prepares students for higher-level subjects
  in fluid dynamics.
