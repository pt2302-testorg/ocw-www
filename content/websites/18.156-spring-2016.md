course_description: "In this course, we study elliptic Partial Differential Equations\
  \ (PDEs) with variable coefficients building up to the minimal surface equation.\
  \ Then we study Fourier and harmonic analysis, emphasizing applications of Fourier\
  \ analysis. We will see some applications in combinatorics / number theory, like\
  \ the Gauss circle problem, but mostly focus on applications in PDE, like the Calderon-Zygmund\
  \ inequality for the Laplacian,\_and the Strichartz inequality for the Schrodinger\
  \ equation. In the last part of the course, we study solutions to the linear and\
  \ the non-linear Schrodinger equation. All through the course, we work on the craft\
  \ of proving estimates.\n"
