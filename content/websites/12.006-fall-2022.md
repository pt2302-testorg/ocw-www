course_description: This course provides an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and
  chaos in dissipative systems. The content is structured to be of general interest
  to undergraduates in science and engineering. The course concentrates on simple
  models of dynamical systems, mathematical theory underlying their behavior, their
  relevance to natural phenomena, and methods of data analysis and interpretation.
  The emphasis is on nonlinear phenomena that may be described by a few variables
  that evolve with time.
