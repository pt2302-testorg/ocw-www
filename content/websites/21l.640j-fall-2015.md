course_description: 'In this class we will come to understand the vast changes in
  Spanish life that have taken place since Franco''s death in 1975. We will focus
  on the new freedom from censorship, the re-emergence of movements for regional autonomy,
  the new cinema, reforms in education and changes in daily life: Sex roles, work,
  and family that have occurred in the last decade. In so doing, we will examine myths
  that are often considered commonplaces when describing Spain and its people.
