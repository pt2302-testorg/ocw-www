course_description: 'In this subject, we explore the harmonic, melodic, and formal
  practices of western music, principally the so-called "Classical" idiom of central
  Europe, ca. 1750-1825. Topics include a quick review of material covered in 21M.301,
  chromatic harmony (vii{{< sup "o7" >}}, bII{{< sup "6" >}}, and chords of the augmented
  sixth), and chromatic modulation; lecture study and discussion are complemented
  by work in the keyboard laboratory and sight-singing laboratory. All areas of study
  will be integrated in a semester-long project of composing a theme and two variations
  in Classical style.
