course_description: 'This project-based course will explore the future of textiles,
  focusing particularly on blending rich crafting traditions with new technologies.
  Topics will include textile-based electronics, textile fabrication, algorithmic
  pattern design, and composites. We will experiment with a wide range of fibers,
  yarns, and fabrics including traditional materials like wool and cotton as well
  as metal fibers and yarns, fusible plastics, papers, and resins. We will also explore
  techniques like felting, laser cutting, CNC knitting, digital printing, and CNC
  embroidery. Students will complete weekly hands-on assignments and a final project.
