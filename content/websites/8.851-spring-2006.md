course_description: 'This is a course in the construction and application of effective
  field theories, which are the modern tool of choice in making predictions based
  on the Standard Model. Concepts such as matching, renormalization, the operator
  product expansion, power counting, and running with the renormalization group will
  be discussed. Topics will be taken from factorization in hard processes relevant
  for the LHC, heavy quark decays and CP violation, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic
  bound states in field theory (QED and QCD), nucleon effective theories with a fine-tuning,
  and possibly other subjects from QCD, electroweak physics, and gravity.
