course_description: 'Toy Product Design is a [MIT Public Service Center](http://web.mit.edu/mitpsc/about/mission.shtml)
  service learning design course offered in the Spring semester. This course, previously
  listed as SP.778, is an introduction to the product design process with a focus
  on designing for play and entertainment.


  In this course, students work in small teams of 5-6 members to design and prototype
  new toys. Students work closely with a local sponsor, an elementary school, and
  experienced mentors on a themed toy design project. Students will be introduced
  to the product development process, including determining customer needs; brainstorming;
  estimation; sketching; sketch modeling; concept development; design aesthetics;
  detailed design; prototyping; and written, visual, and oral communication.


  At the end of the course, students present their toy products at the Playsentations
  to toy designers, engineers, elementary school children and the MIT community.
