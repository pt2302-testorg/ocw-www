course_description: 'When John Locke declared (in the 1690 Essay Concerning Human
  Understanding) that knowledge was derived solely from experience, he raised the
  possibility that human understanding and identity were not the products of God''s
  will or of immutable laws of nature so much as of one''s personal history and background.
  If on the one hand Locke''s theory led some to pronounce that individuals could
  determine the course of their own lives, however, the idea that we are the products
  of our experience just as readily supported the conviction that we are nothing more
  than machines acting out lives whose destinies we do not control. This course will
  track the formulation of that problem, and a variety of responses to it, in the
  literature of the "long eighteenth century." Readings will range widely across genre,
  from lyric poetry and the novel to diary entries, philosophical prose, and political
  essays, including texts by Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Mary Astell, David Hume,
  Laurence Sterne, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Hays, and Mary Shelley. Topics to be discussed
  include the construction of gender identities; the individual in society; imagination
  and the poet''s work. There will be two essays, one 5-6 pages and one 8-10 pages
  in length, and required presentations.
