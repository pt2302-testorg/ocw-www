course_description: 'This is a seminar about the ways that urban design contributes
  to the distribution of political power and resources in cities. "Design," in this
  view, is not some value-neutral aesthetic applied to efforts at urban development
  but is, instead, an integral part of the motives driving that development. The class
  investigates the nature of the relations between built form and political purposes
  through close examination of a wide variety of situations where public and private
  sector design commissions and planning processes have been clearly motivated by
  political pressures, as well as situations where the political assumptions have
  remained more tacit. We will explore cases from both developed and developing countries.
