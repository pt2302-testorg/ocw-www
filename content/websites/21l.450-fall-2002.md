course_description: "The aim of this subject is to acquaint the student with some\
  \ important works of systematic ethical philosophy and to bring to bear the viewpoint\
  \ of those works on the study of classic works of literature. This subject will\
  \ trace the history of ethical speculation in systematic philosophy by identifying\
  \ four major positions: two from the ancient world and the two most important traditions\
  \ of ethical philosophy since the renaissance. The two ancient positions will be\
  \ represented by Plato and Aristotle, the two modern positions by Immanuel Kant\
  \ and John Stuart Mill.\_We will try to understand these four positions as engaged\
  \ in a rivalry with one another, and we will also engage with the philosophy of\
  \ Thomas Hobbes, which offers a bridge between ancient and modern conceptions and\
  \ provides a source for the rivalry between the viewpoints of Kant and Mill.\_Further,\
  \ we will be mindful that the modern positions are subject to criticism today by\
  \ new currents of philosophical speculation, some of which argue for a return to\
  \ the positions of Plato and Aristotle.\n"
