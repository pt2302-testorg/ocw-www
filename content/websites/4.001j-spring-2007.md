course_description: 'Do you want to think about ways to help solve New Orleans'' problems?
  CityScope is a project-based introduction to the contemporary city. "Problem solving
  in complex (urban) environments" is different than "solving complex problems." As
  a member of a team, you will learn to assess scenarios for the purpose of formulating
  social, economic and design strategies to provide humane and sustainable solutions.
  A visit to New Orleans is planned for spring break 2007.
