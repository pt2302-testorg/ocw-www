course_description: 'This course examines classical and quantum models of electrons
  and lattice vibrations in solids, emphasizing physical models for elastic properties,
  electronic transport, and heat capacity. Topics covered include: crystal lattices,
  electronic energy band structures, phonon dispersion relatons, effective mass theorem,
  semiclassical equations of motion, and impurity states in semiconductors, band structure
  and transport properties of selected semiconductors, and connection of quantum theory
  of solids with quasifermi levels and Boltzmann transport used in device modeling.
