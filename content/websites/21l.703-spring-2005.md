course_description: "This course explores the creation (and creativity) of the modern\
  \ scientific and cultural world through study of western Europe in the 17th century,\
  \ the age of Descartes and Newton, Shakespeare, Rembrandt and Moli\xE8re. The class\
  \ compares period thinking to present-day debates about the scientific method, art,\
  \ religion, and society. This team-taught, interdisciplinary subject draws on a\
  \ wide range of literary, dramatic, historical, and scientific texts and images,\
  \ and involves theatrical experimentation as well as reading, writing, researching\
  \ and conversing.\n"
