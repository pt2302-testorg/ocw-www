course_description: "The fact of scarcity forces individuals, firms, and societies\
  \ to choose among alternative uses \u2013 or allocations \u2013 of its limited resources.\
  \ Accordingly, the first part of this summer course seeks to understand how economists\
  \ model the choice process of individual consumers and firms, and how markets work\
  \ to coordinate these choices. It also examines how well markets perform this function\
  \ using the economist's criterion of market efficiency.\n\nOverall, this course\
  \ focuses on microeconomics, with some topics from macroeconomics and international\
  \ trade. It emphasizes the integration of theory, data, and judgment in the analysis\
  \ of corporate decisions and public policy, and in the assessment of changing U.S.\
  \ and international business environments.\n"
