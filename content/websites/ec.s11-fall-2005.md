course_description: 'This multidisciplinary seminar addresses fundamental issues in
  global health faced by community-based healthcare programs in developing countries.
  Students will broadly explore topics with expert lecturers and guided readings.
  Topics will be further illuminated with case studies from healthcare programs in
  urban centers of Zambia. Multidisciplinary teams will be formed to develop feasible
  solutions to specific health challenges posed in the case studies and encouraged
  to pursue their ideas beyond the seminar. Possible global health topics include
  community-based AIDS/HIV management, maternity care, health diagnostics, and information
  technology in patient management and tracking. Students from Medicine, Public Health,
  Engineering, Management, and Social Sciences are encouraged to enroll. No specific
  background experience is expected, but students should have some relevant skills
  or experiences.
