course_description: "This class introduces elementary programming concepts including\
  \ variable types, data structures, and flow control. After an introduction to linear\
  \ algebra and probability, it covers numerical methods relevant to mechanical engineering,\
  \ including approximation (interpolation, least squares and statistical regression),\
  \ integration, solution of linear and nonlinear equations, ordinary differential\
  \ equations, and deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Examples are drawn\
  \ from mechanical engineering disciplines, in particular from robotics, dynamics,\
  \ and structural analysis. Assignments require MATLAB\xAE programming."
