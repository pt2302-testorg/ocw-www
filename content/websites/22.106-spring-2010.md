course_description: 'This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts
  and methods of transport theory needed in neutron science applications. This course
  is a foundational study of the effects of multiple interactions on neutron distributions
  and their applications to problems across the Nuclear Engineering department. Stochastic
  and deterministic simulation techniques will be introduced to the students.
