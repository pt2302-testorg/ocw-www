course_description: 'This course investigates the principles of thermal radiation
  and their applications to engineering heat and photon transfer problems. Topics
  include quantum and classical models of radiative properties of materials, electromagnetic
  wave theory for thermal radiation, radiative transfer in absorbing, emitting, and
  scattering media, and coherent laser radiation. Applications cover laser-material
  interactions, imaging, infrared instrumentation, global warming, semiconductor manufacturing,
  combustion, furnaces, and high temperature processing.
