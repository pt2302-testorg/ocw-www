course_description: This course provides the fundamental computational toolbox for
  solving science and engineering problems. Topics include review of linear algebra,
  applications to networks, structures, estimation, finite difference and finite element
  solutions of differential equations, Laplace's equation and potential flow, boundary-value
  problems, Fourier series, the discrete Fourier transform, and convolution. We will
  also explore many topics in AI and machine learning throughout the course.
