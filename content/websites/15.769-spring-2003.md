course_description: "This course will address operations strategy by building on the\
  \ concepts of:\n\n1.  Reengineering and process design developed by Dr. Michael\
  \ Hammer.\n2.  Manufacturing strategy as developed in the literature, primarily\
  \ by people at HBS.\n3.  Supply chain design and 3-D concurrent engineering literature\
  \ as developed in Charles Fine\u2019s book, _Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control\
  \ in the Age of Temporary Advantage._ Perseus Books, 1999.\n\nThe concepts there\
  \ emphasize the necessity of integrating product strategy, manufacturing strategy,\
  \ and supply chain strategy.\_As a result, each of these will be touched upon in\
  \ the course.\n"
