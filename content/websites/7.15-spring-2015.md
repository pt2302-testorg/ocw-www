course_description: "This project-based laboratory course provides students with in-depth\
  \ experience in experimental molecular genetics, using modern methods of molecular\
  \ biology and genetics to conduct original research. The course is geared towards\
  \ students (including sophomores) who have a strong interest in a future career\
  \ in biomedical research. This semester will focus on chemical genetics using _Caenorhabditis\
  \ elegans_ as a model system. Students will gain experience in research rationale\
  \ and methods, as well as training in the planning, execution, and communication\
  \ of experimental biology.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in\
  \ these materials are potentially hazardous and require a high level of safety training,\
  \ special facilities and equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals.\
  \ You bear the sole responsibility, liability, and risk for the implementation of\
  \ such safety procedures and measures. MIT shall have no responsibility, liability,\
  \ or risk for the content or implementation of any of the material presented.  \n\
