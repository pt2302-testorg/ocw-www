course_description: "This course presents the main concepts of decision analysis,\
  \ artificial intelligence, and predictive model construction and evaluation in the\
  \ specific context of medical applications. The advantages and disadvantages of\
  \ using these methods in real-world systems\_are emphasized, while students gain\
  \ hands-on experience with application specific methods. The technical focus of\
  \ the course includes decision analysis, knowledge-based systems (qualitative and\
  \ quantitative), learning systems (including logistic regression, classification\
  \ trees, neural networks), and techniques to evaluate the performance of such systems.\n"
