course_description: 'This freshman-level course is the second semester of introductory
  physics. The focus is on electricity and magnetism. The subject is taught using
  the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) format which utilizes small group
  interaction and current technology. The TEAL/Studio Project at MIT is a new approach
  to physics education designed to help students develop much better intuition about,
  and conceptual models of, physical phenomena.
