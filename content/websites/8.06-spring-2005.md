course_description: 'Together, this course and its predecessor, [8.05: Quantum Physics
  II](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/), cover quantum physics with applications
  drawn from modern physics. Topics in this course include units, time-independent
  approximation methods, the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles
  in a magnetic field, scattering, and time-dependent perturbation theory. In this
  second term, students are required to research and write a paper on a topic related
  to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.
