  \ subfield of economics that incorporates insights from psychology and other social\
  \ sciences into economics. This course covers recent advances in behavioral economics\
  \ by reviewing some of the assumptions made\_in mainstream economic models, and\
  \ by discussing how human behavior systematically departs from these assumptions.\_\
  Applications will cover a wide range of fields, including labor and public economics,\
  \ industrial organization, health economics, finance, and development economics.\n"
