course_description: 'The aim of this course is to introduce and analyze the international
  relations of East Asia. With four great powers, three nuclear weapons states, and
  two of the world''s largest economies, East Asia is one of the most dynamic and
  consequential regions in world politics. This course will examine the sources of
  conflict and cooperation in both periods, assessing competing explanations for key
  events in East Asia''s international relations. Readings will be drawn from international
  relations theory, political science and history.
