course_description: 'This seminar is an introduction to the usage and impacts of information
  and communication technologies (ICTs) on urban planning, the urban environment and
  communities. Students will explore how social relationships, our sense of community,
  the urban infrastructure, and planning practice have been affected by technological
  change. Literature reviews, guest speakers, and web surfing will provide examples
  and issues that are debated in class and homework exercises. We will examine metropolitan
  information infrastructures, urban modeling and visualization, e-government, collaborative
  planning, and cyber communities.


  Students will attend a regular Tuesday seminar and occasional seminars of invited
  speakers during lunchtime on Fridays or Mondays.


  During the past two decades, ICTs have become so pervasive and disruptive that their
  impact on urban planning and social relationships has begun to reach far beyond
  their immediate use as efficient bookkeeping and automation tools. This seminar
  will examine ICT impacts on our sense of community, urban planning practice, the
  meaning of ''place'', and the nature of metropolitan governance. In each of the
  four areas, we will utilize readings, class discussion, guest lectures, and homework
  exercises to identify and critique key trends, relevant theories, and promising
  directions for research and professional practice.
