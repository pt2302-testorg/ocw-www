course_description: 'The television landscape has changed drastically in the past
  few years; nowhere is this more prevalent than in the American daytime serial drama,
  one of the oldest forms of television content. This class examines the history of
  these "soap operas" and their audiences by focusing on the production, consumption,
  and media texts of soaps. The class will include discussions of what makes soap
  operas a unique form, the history of the genre, current experimentation with transmedia
  storytelling, the online fan community, and comparisons between daytime dramas and
  primetime serials from _24_ to _Friday Night Lights_, through a study of Procter
  & Gamble''s _As the World Turns_.
