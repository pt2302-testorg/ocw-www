course_description: "Structure\u2014or the arrangement of materials\u2019 internal\
  \ components\u2014determines virtually everything about a material: its properties,\
  \ its potential applications, and its performance within those applications. This\
  \ three-part course explores the structure of a wide variety of materials with current-day\
  \ engineering applications. Taken together, the three modules provide similar content\
  \ to MIT\u2019s sophomore-level materials structure curriculum.\n\nPart 1 of the\
  \ course introduces amorphous materials and explores glasses and polymers, the factors\
  \ that influence their structure, and how materials scientists measure and describe\
  \ the structure of these materials. Then we discuss what it means for a material\
  \ to be crystalline, how we describe periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal,\
  \ and how we can determine the structure of crystals through x-ray diffraction.\
  \ Parts 2 and 3 explore the structure of materials in further depth.\n\nThis course\
  \ was organized as a three-part series on [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx)\_\
  by MIT\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering and is now archived\
  \ on the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), which is free to\
  \ use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each module if you want to track\
  \ your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.\n"
