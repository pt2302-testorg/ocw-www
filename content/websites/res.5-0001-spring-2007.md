course_description: 'The "Digital Lab Techniques Manual" is a series of videos designed
  to help you prepare for your chemistry laboratory class. Each video provides a detailed
  demonstration of a common laboratory technique, as well as helpful tips and information.
  These videos are meant to supplement, and not replace, your lab manual and assigned
  reading. In fact, you will most benefit from watching the videos if you have already
  read the appropriate background information. To be a great experimentalist, you
  must understand both theory and technique! If you have questions about what you
  see, make sure to ask your TA or your instructor.


  WARNING NOTICE:


  The experiments described in these materials are potentially hazardous and require
  a high level of safety training, special facilities and equipment, and supervision
  by appropriate individuals. You bear the sole responsibility, liability, and risk
  for the implementation of such safety procedures and measures. MIT shall have no
  responsibility, liability, or risk for the content or implementation of any of the
  material presented. [Legal Notice](/terms/)
