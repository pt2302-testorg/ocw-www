course_description: 'The course focuses on skills managers need to adapt to current
  sweeping changes in the nature of work and the workforce, in business organizations
  and their roles in society, and in the institutions that interact with work, particularly
  the labor market, community and family-centered groups. This year''s teaching will
  be the basis for a workshop session at the Sloan School''s 50th Anniversary Convocation.


  The course will involve a mix of on-campus and off-campus students taking the course
  via distance learning, and professionals from a variety of organizations who will
  participate in specific modules of interest to them. One session will be linked
  to colleagues at Cambridge University in England where a parallel course is being
  offered.


  Managerial issues addressed are associated with managing changes and innovations
  occurring in the nature of work and organizations and the role of the corporation
  in society. Topics covered include the changing social contract at work, integrating
  work and family, managing diversity, managing strategic labor-management partnerships,
  and managing relations between the firm and its multiple stakeholders. Subject is
  open to distance learning as well as on-campus students and to industry participants.
