course_description: 'This course introduces students to the art and formal ideologies
  of contemporary dance. We explore the aesthetic and technical underpinnings of contemporary
  dance composition. Basic compositional techniques are discussed and practiced, with
  an emphasis on principles such as weight, space, time, effort, and shape. Principles
  of musicality are considered and developed by each student. Working with each other
  as the raw material of the dance, students develop short compositions that reveal
  their understanding of basic techniques. Hopefully, students come to understand
  a range of compositional possibilities available to artists who work with the medium
  of the human body.
