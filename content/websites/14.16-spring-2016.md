course_description: "This is an advanced course in game theory. We begin with a rigorous\
  \ overview of the main\_equilibrium concepts for non-\xADcooperative games in both\
  \ static and dynamic settings with either complete or incomplete information. We\
  \ define and explore properties of iterated strict dominance, rationalizability,\
  \ Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, sequential, perfect and proper equilibria,\
  \ the intuitive criterion, and iterated weak dominance. We discuss applications\
  \ to auctions, bargaining, and repeated games. Then we introduce solution concepts\
  \ for cooperative games and study non-\xADcooperative implementations.\_Other topics\
  \ include matching theory and networks.\n"
