course_description: 'The economic growth of developing countries requires the acquisition
  of technological capabilities. In countries at the world technological frontier,
  such capabilities refer to cutting edge skills to innovate entirely new products.
  In developing countries, the requisite technological capabilities are broader, and
  include production engineering, project execution and incremental innovation to
  make borrowed technology work. Theories of technology acquisition are examined.
  The empirical evidence is taken from two sets of developing countries; the most
  advanced (Taiwan, Korea, India, China and Brazil) and the least advanced (Africa
  and Middle Eastern countries).
