course_description: 'This course covers a number of advanced "selected topics" in
  the field of cryptography. The first part of the course tackles the foundational
  question of how to define security of cryptographic protocols in a way that is appropriate
  for modern computer networks, and how to construct protocols that satisfy these
  security definitions. For this purpose, the framework of "universally composable
  security" is studied and used. The second part of the course concentrates on the
  many challenges involved in building secure electronic voting systems, from both
  theoretical and practical points of view. In the third part, an introduction to
  cryptographic constructions based on bilinear pairings is given.
