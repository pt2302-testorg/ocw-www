course_description: "This studio explores the notion of in-between by engaging several\
  \ relationships; the relationship between intervention and perception, between representation\
  \ and notation and between the fixed and the temporal. In the _Exactitude in Science_,\
  \ Jorge Luis Borges tells the perverse tale of the one to one scale map, where the\
  \ desire for precision and power leads to the escalating production of larger and\
  \ more accurate maps of the territory. For Jean Baudrillard, \"The territory no\
  \ longer precedes the map nor survives it. \u2026it is the map that precedes the\
  \ territory... and thus, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting\
  \ across the map.\"\_The map or the territory, left to ruin-shredding across the\
  \ 'other', beautifully captures the tension between reality and representation.\_\
  Mediating between collective desire and territorial surface, maps filter, create,\
  \ frame, scale, orient, and project.\_A map has agency. It is not merely representational\
  \ but operational, the experience and discursive potential of this process lies\
  \ in the reciprocity between the representation and the real. It is in-between these\
  \ specific sets of relationships that this studio positions itself.\n"
