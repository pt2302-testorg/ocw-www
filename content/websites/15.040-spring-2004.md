course_description: "This half-term course examines the choices that we make which\
  \ affect others and the choices others make that affect us. Such situations are\
  \ known as \"games\" and game-playing, while sounding whimsical, is serious business.\
  \ Managers frequently play \"games\" both within the firm and outside it\_\u2013\
  \ with competitors, customers, regulators, and even capital markets! The goal of\
  \ this course is to enhance\_a student's ability to think strategically in complex,\
  \ interactive environments. Knowledge of game theory will give students an advantage\
  \ in such strategic settings. The course is structured around three \"themes for\
  \ acquiring advantage in games\": commitment / strategic moves, exploiting hidden\
  \ information, and limited rationality.\n"
