course_description: 'This course includes:


  *   Surveying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal communication.

  *   Coversion channels in excitable membrane, synaptic transmission, and synaptic
  plasticity.

  *   Correlation of the properties of ion channels and synaptic transmission with
  their physiological function such as learning and memory.

  *   Discussion of the organizational principles for the formation of functional
  neural networks at synaptic and cellular levels.
