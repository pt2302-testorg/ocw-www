course_description: 'This class surveys developmental entrepreneurship via case examples
  of both successful and failed businesses and generally grapples with deploying and
  diffusing products and services through entrepreneurial action. By drawing on live
  and historical cases, especially from South Asia, Africa, Latin America as well
  as Eastern Europe, China, and other developing regions, we seek to cover the broad
  spectrum of challenges and opportunities facing developmental entrepreneurs. Finally,
  we explore a range of established and emerging business models as well as new business
  opportunities enabled by developmental technologies developed in MIT labs and beyond.
