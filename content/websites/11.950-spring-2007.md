course_description: "Citizen participation is everywhere. Invoking it has become _de\
  \ rigueur_ when discussing cities and regions in the developing world. From the\
  \ World Bank to the World Social Forum, the virtues of participation are extolled:\
  \ From its capacity to \"deepen democracy\" to its ability to improve governance,\
  \ there is no shortage to the benefits it can bring. While it is clear that participation\
  \ cannot possibly \"do\" all that is claimed, it is also clear that citizen participation\
  \ cannot be dismissed, and that there must be something to it. Figuring out what\
  \ that something is \u2014 whether it is identifying the types of participation\
  \ or the contexts in which it happens that bring about desirable outcomes \u2014\
  \ is the goal of the class.\n"
