course_description: 'This introductory course helps students learn to pose questions
  and analyze problems in the field of planning in developing countries. Not arguing
  for one "right" approach, the course draws on grounded empirical experiences - historical
  and recent - to help students navigate the way they approach their future work in
  developing-country governments, NGOs and international organizations.
