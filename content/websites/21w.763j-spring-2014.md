course_description: 'Transmedia narratives exist across multiple storytelling platforms,
  using the advantages of each to enhance the experience of the audience. No matter
  which medium nor how many, the heart of any successful transmedia project is a good
  story. In this class we will spend time on the basics of solid storytelling in speculative
  fiction before we move on to how to translate those elements into various media.
  We will then explore how different presentations in different media can complement
  and enhance our storytelling. While we will read scholarly articles and discuss
  ideas about transmedia, this is primarily a class in making speculative fiction
  transmedia projects. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various mediums
  and consider how they complement each other, and how by using several different
  media we can give the audience a more complete, rewarding, and immersive experience.
