course_description: 'This class explores the artistry of Lighting Design. Students
  gain an overall technical working knowledge of the tools of the trade, and learn
  how, and where to apply them to a final design. However essential technical expertise
  is, the class stresses the artistic, conceptual, collaborative side of the craft.
  The class format is a "hands on" approach, with a good portion of class time spent
  in a theatre.
