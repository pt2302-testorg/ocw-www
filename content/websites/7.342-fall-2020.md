course_description: "Metastatic disease is responsible for the vast majority of deaths\
  \ associated with cancer, yet our understanding of how metastases arise is still\
  \ developing. In this course, we will introduce various concepts and models that\
  \ have been proposed to explain how cancer cells disseminate from a primary tumor\
  \ to distant anatomical sites. We\u2019ll learn about the critical factors that\
  \ influence cancer metastasis frontiers through analysis and discussion of relevant\
  \ primary research articles, with an emphasis on mechanisms of metastasis that can\
  \ be applied across different cancer types. Students will gain a broad understanding\
  \ of the field of cancer metastasis, including state-of-the-art techniques that\
  \ are being used to address pressing questions in the field.\n\nThis course is one\
  \ of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
