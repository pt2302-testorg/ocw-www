course_description: 'For all of the bodies attached to the many great minds that walk
  the Institute''s halls, in the work that goes on at MIT the body is present as an
  object of study, but is all but unrecognized as an important dimension of our intelligence
  and experience. Yet the body is the basis of our experience in the world; it is
  the very foundation on which cognitive intelligence is built. Using the MIT gymnastics
  gym as our laboratory, the Physical Intelligence activity will take an innovative,
  hands-on approach to explore the kinesthetic intelligence of the body as applicable
  to a wide range of disciplines. Via exercises, activities, readings and discussions
  designed to excavate our physical experience, we will not only develop balance,
  agility, flexibility and strength, but a deep appreciation for the inherent unity
  of mind and body that suggests physical intelligence as a powerful complement to
  cognitive intelligence.
