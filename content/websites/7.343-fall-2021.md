course_description: "Did you know that we have approximately 2 meters of DNA packed\
  \ in our cells, which are less than 10 \u03BCm diameter? Or that to replicate DNA\
  \ it is copied at a rate of 70,000 basepairs per second by a cellular apparatus\
  \ that coordinates at least six different enzymes? Or that microtubules form greater\
  \ than 1 meter long \u201Crailways\u201D upon which molecular machines transport\
  \ cargo within nerve cells? In this course, we will explore how single-molecule\
  \ imaging techniques capture the mega-cellular machines working in real-time.\n\n\
  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
