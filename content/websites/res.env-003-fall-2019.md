course_description: "The Climate 101 presentation was developed by Brandon Leshchinskiy\
  \ in collaboration with Professor Dava Newman, MIT Portugal, and EarthDNA in an\
  \ effort to mobilize young people as educators on the issue of climate change. The\
  \ presentation addresses not only the science but also the\_economics and civics\
  \ of climate change, incorporating\_a negotiation activity that brings key concepts\
  \ to life.\n\nThis resource includes the slides and instructions for the presentation,\
  \ along with an introductory video from Prof. Newman, a video of Leshchinskiy actually\
  \ delivering the presentation to a classroom full of students, and extensive supporting\
  \ materials that will help users to become climate ambassadors and deliver the Climate\
  \ 101 presentation themselves.\n"
