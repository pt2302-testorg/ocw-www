course_description: 'There has been much discussion in recent years, on this campus
  and elsewhere, about the death of the book. Digitization and various forms of electronic
  media, some critics say, are rendering the printed text as obsolete as the writing
  quill. In this subject, we will examine the claims for and against the demise of
  the book, but we will also supplement these arguments with an historical perspective
  they lack: we will examine texts, printing technologies, and reading communities
  from roughly 1450 to the present. We will begin with the theoretical and historical
  overviews of Walter Ong and Elizabeth Eisenstein, after which we will study specific
  cases such as English chapbooks, Inkan knotted and dyed strings, late nineteenth-century
  recording devices, and newspapers online today. We will also visit a rare book library
  and make a poster on a hand-set printing press.
