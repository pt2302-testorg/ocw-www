course_description: 'This course explores electromagnetic phenomena in modern applications,
  including wireless communications, circuits, computer interconnects and peripherals,
  optical fiber links and components, microwave communications and radar, antennas,
  sensors, micro-electromechanical systems, motors, and power generation and transmission.
  Fundamentals covered include: quasistatic and dynamic solutions to Maxwell''s equations;
  waves, radiation, and diffraction; coupling to media and structures; guided and
  unguided waves; resonance; and forces, power, and energy.
