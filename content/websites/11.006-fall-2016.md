course_description: 'This course explores the evolution of poverty and economic security
  in the United States, within a global context. It examines the impact of recent
  economic restructuring and globalization, and reviews the current debate about the
  fate of the middle class, sources of increasing inequality, and approaches to advancing
  economic opportunity and security. In this class, students will study the topic
  of poverty and economic security through the lens of the lived experience of Americans:
  individuals, families, and households; exploring the history, geography, and forces
  shaping the likelihood of being poor in America.
