course_description: "This is the third of the four courses (Chinese I through IV)\
  \ in MIT's regular (non-streamlined) Chinese curriculum. The four make use of the\
  \ textbook, _Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin_ (unpublished, but\
  \ available online), to which are added various supporting materials as needs arise.\
  \ The foundation level covers core grammar, linguistic culture, basic conversation,\
  \ the principles of the writing system, and elementary reading. Reading is primarily\
  \ in the simplified character set that is the standard on the Mainland, but also\
  \ in the traditional set that is still standard in Taiwan and many overseas communities.\n\
  \nAll four subjects in the foundation level are (Chinese I and II) or soon will\
  \ be (Chinese IV) available on OCW. Students who have advanced through Chinese I\
  \ and II to reach this level, as well as those entering at Chinese III, should review\
  \ at least the late material in Chinese II before proceeding. To facilitate review,\
  \ as well as to orient students who are new to these materials, highlights from\
  \ all the units in Chinese I and II and a list of the characters formally introduced\
  \ in Character lessons 1-6 are included in the [readings](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2005/pages/readings)\
  \ section of this course.\n\n### Chinese Sequence on OCW\n\nOpenCourseWare now offers\
  \ a complete sequence of four Chinese language courses, covering beginning to intermediate\
  \ levels of instruction at MIT. They can be used not just as the basis for taught\
  \ courses, but also for self-instruction and elementary-to-intermediate review.\n\
  \nThe four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online textbook\
  \ in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's _Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin_;\
  \ audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in this book; and\
  \ syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term.\n\n{{< tableopen >}}\n\n\n{{<\
