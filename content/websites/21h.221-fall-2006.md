course_description: 'This course examines the history of the United States as a "nation
  of immigrants" within a broader global context. It considers migration from the
  mid-19th century to the present through case studies of such places as New York''s
  Lower East Side, South Texas, Florida, and San Francisco''s Chinatown. It also examines
  the role of memory, media, and popular culture in shaping ideas about migration.
  The course includes optional field trip to New York City.
