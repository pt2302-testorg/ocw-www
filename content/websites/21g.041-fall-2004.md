course_description: 'This subject aims to provide an overview of contemporary texts
  in regional languages in South Asian Literature and Cinema. We will cover major
  authors and film makers, writing from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
  Lanka. Within India, we will look at authors and directors working in different
  regional languages and as we examine their different socio-cultural, political and
  historical contexts we will attempt to understand what it means to study them under
  the all-unifying category of "South Asian Literature and Culture". Some of the major
  issues we shall explore include caste, gender, globalization and social change.
  We will end with exploring some of the newer, younger writers and directors and
  try to analyze some of the thematic and formal shifts in their work. Authors include
  Ashapurna Devi, Manto, Vijayan, Premchand, Mohanty, and Nasreen and film makers
  will include Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Satyajit Ray, Shyam Benegal, Aparna Sen and Rituporno
  Ghosh.
