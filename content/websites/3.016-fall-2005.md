course_description: 'This course covers the mathematical techniques necessary for
  understanding of materials science and engineering topics such as energetics, materials
  structure and symmetry, materials response to applied fields, mechanics and physics
  of solids and soft materials. The class uses examples from the materials science
  and engineering core courses ([3.012](/courses/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/)
  and [3.014](/courses/3-014-materials-laboratory-fall-2006/)) to introduce mathematical
  concepts and materials-related problem solving skills. Topics include linear algebra
  and orthonormal basis, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, quadratic forms, tensor operations,
  symmetry operations, calculus of several variables, introduction to complex analysis,
  ordinary and partial differential equations, theory of distributions, and fourier
  analysis.
