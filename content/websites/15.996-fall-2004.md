course_description: 'Cross Cultural Leadership is a collaborative research seminar
  that examines what constitutes "effective" leadership across cultures. It is collaborative
  because the students are expected to provide some of the content. The weekly readings
  target particular aspects of cultural differentiation. Working within those topics,
  students are asked to describe aspects of leadership in particular cultures based
  on their research and/or personal experiences. The goal of the course is to help
  prepare students for business assignments outside of their native countries.


  Course deliverables include: active participation in the class, contribution of
  class content on a weekly basis and an end of course paper that explores some aspect
  of leadership across cultures.
