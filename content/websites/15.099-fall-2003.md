course_description: 'In keeping with the tradition of the last twenty-some years,
  the Readings in Optimization seminar will focus on an advanced topic of interest
  to a portion of the MIT optimization community: randomized methods for deterministic
  optimization. In contrast to conventional optimization algorithms whose iterates
  are computed and analyzed deterministically, randomized methods rely on stochastic
  processes and random number/vector generation as part of the algorithm and/or its
  analysis. In the seminar, we will study some very recent papers on this topic, many
  by MIT faculty, as well as some older papers from the existing literature that are
  only now receiving attention.
