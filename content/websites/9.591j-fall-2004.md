course_description: 'This course is a seminar in real-time language comprehension.
  It considers models of sentence and discourse comprehension from the linguistic,
  psychology, and artificial intelligence literature, including symbolic and connectionist
  models. Topics include ambiguity resolution and linguistic complexity; the use of
  lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, contextual and prosodic information in
  language comprehension; the relationship between the computational resources available
  in working memory and the language processing mechanism; and the psychological reality
  of linguistic representations.
