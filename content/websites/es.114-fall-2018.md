course_description: 'This course addresses the philosophical question of what a non-violent
  life entails. It investigates its ethical dimensions and challenges, and considers
  whether we can derive a comprehensive moral theory from the principle of non-violence.
  In addition, it discusses the issues of lying, the duty to forgive, non-violent
  communication, the ethics of our relationship to anger, the possibility of loving
  enemies, and the ethics of punishment and rehabilitation. Readings are included
  from primary exponents of non-violence, such as Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King.


  This course is part of the [Experimental Study Group](http://esg.mit.edu/) at MIT.
