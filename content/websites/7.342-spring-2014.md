course_description: 'Human genome sequencing has revolutionized our understanding
  of disease susceptibility, drug metabolism and human ancestry. This course will
  explore how these advances have been made possible by revolutionary new sequencing
  methodologies that have decreased costs and increased throughput of genome analysis,
  making it possible to examine genetic correlates for a variety of biological processes
  and disorders. The course will combine discussions of primary scientific research
  papers with hands-on data analysis and small group presentations.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
