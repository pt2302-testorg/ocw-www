course_description: 'This course is offered to graduates and focuses on understanding
  the fundamental principles of the "front-end" processes used in the fabrication
  of devices for silicon integrated circuits. This includes advanced physical models
  and practical aspects of major processes, such as oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation,
  and epitaxy. Other topics covered include: high performance MOS and bipolar devices
  including ultra-thin gate oxides, implant-damage enhanced diffusion, advanced metrology,
  and new materials such as Silicon Germanium (SiGe).
