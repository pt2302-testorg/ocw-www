course_description: 'D-Lab: Design addresses problems faced by undeserved communities
  with a focus on design, experimentation, and prototyping processes. Particular attention
  is placed on constraints faced when designing for developing countries. Multidisciplinary
  teams work on semester-long projects in collaboration with community partners, field
  practitioners, and experts in relevant fields. Topics covered include design for
  affordability, design for manufacture, sustainability, and strategies for working
  effectively with community partners and customers. Students may continue projects
  begun in [_EC.701J D-Lab I: Development_](courses/sp-721-d-lab-i-development-fall-2009).
