course_description: 'This subject is devoted to reading and discussing basic American
  historical texts that are often cited but often remain unread, understanding their
  meaning, and assessing their continuing significance in American culture. Since
  it is a "Communications Intensive" subject, 21H.105 is also dedicated to improving
  students'' capacities to write and speak well. It requires a substantial amount
  of writing, participation in discussions, and individual presentations to the class.
