course_description: 'The primary focus of this Vocal Repertoire and Performance course
  is placed upon the works of African American composers and concert artists. Students
  gather biographical data and explore art songs, operatic arias, ensembles, choral
  masterpieces, and arrangements employing sacred and secular texts. Additionally,
  students conduct inquiry into works representative of their own heritage. This course
  is required for vocalists in the MIT Emerson Music Performance program; others may
  be admitted by audition.
