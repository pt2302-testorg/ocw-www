course_description: 'Focusing on the emperors Augustus and Nero, this course investigates
  the ways in which Roman emperors used art, architecture, coinage and other media
  to create and project an image of themselves, the ways in which the surviving literary
  sources from the Roman period reinforced or subverted that image, and the ways in
  which both phenomena have contributed to post-classical perceptions of Roman emperors.
  Material studied will include the art, architecture, and coinage of Augustan and
  Neronian Rome, the works of Suetonius and Tacitus, and modern representations of
  the emperors such as those found in _I, Claudius_ and _Quo Vadis_.
