course_description: This course explores the origins of magic, science, and religion
  as forms of belief within and across cultures. It addresses the place of rationality
  and belief in competing sociocultural theories, with a focus on analyzing modern
  perspectives. It also examines how cases of overlap between magic, science, and
  religion raise new questions about modernity and human nature.
