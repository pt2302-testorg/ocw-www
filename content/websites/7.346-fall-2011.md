course_description: 'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) orchestrates different cellular
  processes by which proteins are synthesized, correctly folded, modified and ultimately
  transported to their final destinations. As part of this crucial biosynthetic process,
  proteins that are not properly folded and consequently detrimental to normal cellular
  function are constantly generated. A common signature of many neurodegenerative
  diseases, including Alzheimer''s and Parkinson''s, is accumulation and deposition
  of misfolded proteins that arise when the ability of cells to deal with the burden
  of misfolded proteins is compromised. In this course, we will explore how the ER
  quality control machinery ensures that only properly assembled proteins exit the
  ER while distinguishing between nascent proteins en route to their biologically
  active folded state from those that are terminally misfolded.
