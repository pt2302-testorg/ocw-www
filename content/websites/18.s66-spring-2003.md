course_description: 'The subject of enumerative combinatorics deals with counting
  the number of elements of a finite set. For instance, the number of ways to write
  a positive integer n as a sum of positive integers, taking order into account, is
  _2{{< sup "n-1" >}}_. We will be concerned primarily with _bijective proofs_, i.e.,
  showing that two sets have the same number of elements by exhibiting a bijection
  (one-to-one correspondence) between them. This is a subject which requires little
  mathematical background to reach the frontiers of current research. Students will
  therefore have the opportunity to do original research. It might be necessary to
  limit enrollment.
