course_description: 'Learn to produce great designs, be a more effective engineer,
  and communicate with high emotional and intellectual impact. This project based
  course gives students the ability to understand, contextualize, and analyze engineering
  designs and systems. By learning and applying design thinking, students will more
  effectively solve problems in any domain. Lectures focus on teaching a tested, iterative
  design process as well as techniques to sharpen creative analysis. Guest lectures
  from all disciplines illustrate different approaches to design thinking. This course
  develops students'' skills to conceive, organize, lead, implement, and evaluate
