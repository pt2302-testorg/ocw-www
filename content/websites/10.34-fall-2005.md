course_description: "This course focuses on the use of modern computational and mathematical\
  \ techniques in chemical engineering. Starting from a discussion of linear systems\
  \ as the basic computational unit in scientific computing, methods for solving sets\
  \ of nonlinear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations, and differential-algebraic\
  \ (DAE) systems are presented. Probability theory and its use in physical modeling\
  \ is covered, as is the statistical analysis of data and parameter estimation. The\
  \ finite difference and finite element techniques are presented for converting the\
  \ partial differential equations obtained from transport phenomena to DAE systems.\
  \ The use of these techniques will be demonstrated throughout the course in the\
  \ MATLAB\xAE computing environment.\n"
