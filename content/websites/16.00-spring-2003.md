course_description: 'The fundamental concepts, and approaches of aerospace engineering,
  are highlighted through lectures on aeronautics, astronautics, and design. Active
  learning aerospace modules make use of information technology. Student teams are
  immersed in a hands-on, lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle design project, where they
  design, build, and fly radio-controlled LTA vehicles. The connections between theory
  and practice are realized in the design exercises. Required design reviews precede
  the LTA race competition. The performance, weight, and principal characteristics
  of the LTA vehicles are estimated and illustrated using physics, mathematics, and
  chemistry known to freshmen, the emphasis being on the application of this knowledge
  to aerospace engineering and design rather than on exposure to new science and mathematics.
