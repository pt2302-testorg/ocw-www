course_description: 'This course provides a fast-paced introduction to the C and C++
  programming languages. You will learn the required background knowledge, including
  memory management, pointers, preprocessor macros, object-oriented programming, and
  how to find bugs when you inevitably use any of those incorrectly. There will be
  daily assignments and a small-scale individual project.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
