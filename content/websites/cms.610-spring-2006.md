  shaping the production, marketing, distribution, and consumption of contemporary
  media. It combines perspectives on media industries and systems with an awareness
  of the creative process, the audience, and trends shaping content. There will be
  invited discussions with industry experts in various subject areas. Class projects
  will encourage students to think through the challenges of producing media in an
  industry context. CMS.610 is for undergraduate credit, whereas CMS.922 is for graduate
