course_description: 'Solving the interconnected complex problems that pervade our
  social, environmental, economic, and health systems requires concerted change. To
  achieve the lasting impact necessary for true change to occur, sustainability needs
  to be holistically integrated throughout an academic program, leveraging the knowledge
  of instructors to create a more sustainability-literate population.


  This resource presents materials associated with a four-week noncredit course intended
  to provide current and future educators with the knowledge and skills to infuse
  their lessons and practices with sustainability, along with a link to an online
  resource library designed to help educators find activities and lessons that align
  with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.'
