course_description: "The mammalian immune system is sometimes called a \u201Cliquid\
  \ organ,\u201D capable of rapidly initiating and then resolving potent responses\
  \ to pathogens at almost any location in the organism. What protein machinery drives\
  \ immune cells\u2019 rapid migration? How do cells make pathfinding decisions around\
  \ barriers? How do they find rare pathogens or target cells in complex environments?\n\
  \nThis course will begin by examining the general immunological functions of two\
  \ major immune cell types\u2014T cells and dendritic cells. Through our readings\
  \ and discussions, we will examine the connections between immunotherapy as an emerging\
  \ treatment modality for a variety of cancers and the migration of immune cells.\n\
  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
