course_description: "\uFEFFThis course is divided into two sections, Part I and Part\
  \ II. \_Part I provides an introduction to statistical theory and can be found by\
  \ visiting [14.381 Fall 2018](/courses/14-381-statistical-method-in-economics-fall-2018/).\_\
  \n\nPart II, found here, prepares students for the remainder of the econometrics\
  \ sequence. The emphasis of the course is to understand the basic principles of\
  \ statistical theory. A brief review of probability will be given; however, this\
  \ material is assumed knowledge. The course also covers basic regression analysis.\
  \ Topics covered include probability, random samples, asymptotic methods, point\
  \ estimation, evaluation of estimators, Cramer-Rao theorem, hypothesis tests, Neyman\
  \ Pearson lemma, Likelihood Ratio test, interval estimation, best linear predictor,\
  \ best linear approximation, conditional expectation function, building functional\
  \ forms, regression algebra, Gauss-Markov optimality, finite-sample inference, consistency,\
  \ asymptotic normality, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation.\n"
