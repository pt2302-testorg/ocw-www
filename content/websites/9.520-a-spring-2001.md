course_description: 'The course focuses on the problem of supervised learning within
  the framework of Statistical Learning Theory. It starts with a review of classical
  statistical techniques, including Regularization Theory in RKHS for multivariate
  function approximation from sparse data. Next, VC theory is discussed in detail
  and used to justify classification and regression techniques such as Regularization
  Networks and Support Vector Machines. Selected topics such as boosting, feature
  selection and multiclass classification will complete the theory part of the course.
  During the course we will examine applications of several learning techniques in
  areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, database search and time-series
  analysis and prediction. We will briefly discuss implications of learning theories
  for how the brain may learn from experience, focusing on the neurobiology of object
  recognition. We plan to emphasize hands-on applications and exercises, paralleling
  the rapidly increasing practical uses of the techniques described in the subject.
