course_description: 'This course uses lectures and discussion to introduce the range
  of topics relevant to plasma physics and fusion engineering. An introductory discussion
  of the economic and ecological motivation for the development of fusion power is
  also presented. Contemporary magnetic confinement schemes, theoretical questions,
  and engineering considerations are presented by expert guest lecturers. Students
  enrolled in the course also tour the Plasma Science and Fusion Center experimental
  facilities.
