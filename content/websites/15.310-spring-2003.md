course_description: 'Surveys social psychology and organization theory interpreted
  in the context of the managerial environment. Shares lectures with 15.301, with
  a separate recitation required. 15.301 is intended primarily for non-Sloan students,
  both graduate and undergraduate. Deals with a number of diverse subjects, including
  motivation and reward systems for engineers and scientists in industry; the aging
  of technical groups; the management of R&D matrix organizations; and the architecture
  of R&D laboratories and its effect on communication patterns in the organization.


  15.301 is a core subject for students majoring in management science. A laboratory
  is a required element of the course for these students. It involves projects of
  an applied nature in behavioral science. Emphasizes use of behavioral science research
  methods to test hypotheses concerning organizational behavior. Instruction and practice
  in communication include report writing, team decision-making, and oral and visual
  presentation.
