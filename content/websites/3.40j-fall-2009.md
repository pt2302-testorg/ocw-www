course_description: 'The central point of this course is to provide a physical basis
  that links the structure of materials with their properties, focusing primarily
  on metals. With this understanding in hand, the concepts of alloy design and microstructural
  engineering are also discussed, linking processing and thermodynamics to the structure
  and properties of metals.
