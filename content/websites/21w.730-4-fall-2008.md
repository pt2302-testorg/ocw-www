course_description: "\"What people do with food is an act that reveals how they construe\
  \ the world.\"  \n\\- Marcella Hazan, _The Classic Italian Cookbook_\n\nIf you are\
  \ what you eat, what are you? Food is at once the stuff of life and a potent symbol;\
  \ it binds us to the earth, to our families, and to our cultures. In this class,\
  \ we explore many of the fascinating issues that surround food as both material\
  \ fact and personal and cultural symbol. We read essays by Toni Morrison, Michael\
  \ Pollan, Wendell Berry, and others on such topics as family meals, eating as an\
  \ \"agricultural act\" (Berry), slow food, and food's ability to awaken us to \"\
  our own powers of enjoyment\" (M. F. K. Fisher). We will also read Pollan's most\
  \ recent book, _In Defense of Food_, and discuss the issues it raises as well as\
  \ its rhetorical strategies. Assigned essays will grow out of memories and the texts\
  \ we read, and may include personal narrative as well as essays that depend on research.\
  \ Revision of essays and workshop review of writing in progress are an important\
  \ part of the class. Each student will make one oral presentation in this class.\n"
