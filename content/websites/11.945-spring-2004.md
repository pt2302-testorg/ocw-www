course_description: "The Springfield Studio is a practicum design course that focuses\
  \ on the physical, programmatic, and social renewal of an urban community in Springfield,\
  \ Massachusetts by combining classroom work with an applied class project.\_The\
  \ course content covers the areas of physical design/urban design and the related\
  \ analysis and planning tools used to understand and assess urban conditions from\
  \ a design and development perspective.\_Urban design issues are investigated in\
  \ the context of social and economic challenges within the community.\_Thus, the\
  \ course has dual goals:\n\n1.  analyze physical conditions in the community, assess\
  \ community need, propose physical design interventions; and\n2.  assess community\
  \ capacity and programmatic needs.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to explore the integration\
  \ of social, programmatic and physical development interventions in ways that reinforce\
  \ community revitalization efforts, and to apply this knowledge through the development\
  \ of a formal neighborhood revitalization plan that addresses community needs.\n"
