course_description: 'In this course we shall develop theoretical methods suitable
  for the description of the many-body phenomena, such as Hamiltonian second-quantized
  operator formalism, Greens functions, path integral, functional integral, and the
  quantum kinetic equation. The concepts to be introduced include, but are not limited
  to, the random phase approximation, the mean field theory (aka saddle-point, or
  semiclassical approximation), the tunneling dynamics in imaginary time, instantons,
  Berry phase, coherent state path integral, renormalization group.
