course_description: 'Intensive coverage of precision engineering theory, heuristics,
  and applications pertaining to the design of systems ranging from consumer products
  to machine tools. Topics covered include: economics, project management, and design
  philosophy; principles of accuracy, repeatability, and resolution; error budgeting;
  sensors; sensor mounting; systems design; bearings; actuators and transmissions;
  system integration driven by functional requirements, and operating physics. Emphasis
  on developing creative designs, which are optimized by analytical techniques applied
  via spreadsheets. This is a projects course with lectures consisting of design teams
  presenting their work and the class helping to develop solutions; thereby everyone
  learning from everyone''s projects.
