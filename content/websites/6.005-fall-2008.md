course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles
  and techniques of software development that have greatest impact on practice. Topics
  include capturing the essence of a problem by recognizing and inventing suitable
  abstractions; key paradigms, including state machines, functional programming, and
  object-oriented programming; use of design patterns to bridge gap between models
  and code; the role of interfaces and specification in achieving modularity and decoupling;
  reasoning about code using invariants; testing, test-case generation and coverage;
  and essentials of programming with objects, functions, and abstract types. The course
  includes exercises in modeling, design, implementation and reasoning.
