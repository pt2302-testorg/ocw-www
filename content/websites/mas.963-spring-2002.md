course_description: 'The nature of human identity - how we think of ourselves, how
  we perceive others - is a mutable concept, changing with the rise and fall of religious
  beliefs, social mores, philosophical theories. Today, we live in a world in which
  science and technology are among the most powerful forces reshaping our culture
  - and thus our definitions and perceptions of identity. In this seminar, we will
  examine the impact of science and technology on identity.
