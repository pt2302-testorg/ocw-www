course_description: "6.035 is a course within the department's \"Computer Systems\
  \ and Architecture\" concentration. This course analyzes issues associated with\
  \ the implementation of high-level programming languages. Topics covered include:\
  \ fundamental concepts, functions, and structures of compilers, basic program optimization\
  \ techniques, the interaction of theory and practice, and using tools in building\
  \ software. The course features a multi-person project on design and implementation\
  \ of a compiler that is written in Java\xAE and generates MIPS executable machine\
  \ code. This course is worth 8 Engineering Design Points.\n\nThis course was also\
  \ taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/) (SMA)\
  \ programme as course number SMA 5502 (Computer Language Engineering).\n"
