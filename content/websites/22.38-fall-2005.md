course_description: 'This course covers interpretations of the concept of probability.
  Topics include basic probability rules; random variables and distribution functions;
  functions of random variables; and applications to quality control and the reliability
  assessment of mechanical/electrical components, as well as simple structures and
  redundant systems. The course also considers elements of statistics; Bayesian methods
  in engineering; methods for reliability and risk assessment of complex systems (event-tree
  and fault-tree analysis, common-cause failures, human reliability models); uncertainty
  propagation in complex systems (Monte Carlo methods, Latin Hypercube Sampling);
  and an introduction to Markov models. Examples and applications are drawn from nuclear
  and other industries, waste repositories, and mechanical systems.
