course_description: 'This class provides an introduction to modern art and theories
  of modernism and postmodernism. It focuses on the way artists use the tension between
  fine art and mass culture to mobilize a critique of both. We will examine objects
  of visual art, including painting, sculpture, architecture, photography, prints,
  performance and video. These objects will be viewed in their interaction with advertising,
  caricature, comics, graffiti, television, fashion, folk art, and "primitive" art.
