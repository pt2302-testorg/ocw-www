course_description: This course introduces electrochemical energy systems from the
  perspective of thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport. It surveys analysis and
  design of electrochemical reactions and processes by integrating chemical engineering
  fundamentals with knowledge from diverse fields, including chemistry, electrical
  engineering, and materials science. It also includes applications to fuel cells,
  electrolyzers, and batteries. Students taking graduate version complete additional
  assignments.
