course_description: 'This is a fast-paced introductory course to the C++ programming
  language. It is intended for those with little programming background, though prior
  programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will
  still learn C++-specific constructs and concepts.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
