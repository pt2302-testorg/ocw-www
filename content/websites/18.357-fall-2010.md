course_description: 'This graduate-level course covers fluid systems dominated by
  the influence of interfacial tension. The roles of curvature pressure and Marangoni
  stress are elucidated in a variety of fluid systems. Particular attention is given
  to drops and bubbles, soap films and minimal surfaces, wetting phenomena, water-repellency,
  surfactants, Marangoni flows, capillary origami and contact line dynamics.
