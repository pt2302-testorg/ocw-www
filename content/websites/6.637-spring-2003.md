course_description: '6.637 covers the fundamentals of optical signals and modern optical
  devices and systems from a practical point of view. Its goal is to help students
  develop a thorough understanding of the underlying physical principles such that
  device and system design and performance can be predicted, analyzed, and understood.


  Most optical systems involve the use of one or more of the following: sources (e.g.,
  lasers and light-emitting diodes), light modulation components (e.g., liquid-crystal
  light modulators), transmission media (e.g., free space or fibers), photodetectors
  (e.g., photodiodes, photomultiplier tubes), information storage devices (e.g., optical
  disk), processing systems (e.g., imaging and spatial filtering systems) and displays
  (LCOS microdisplays). These are the topics covered by this course.
