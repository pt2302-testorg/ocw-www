course_description: 'This course is an intermediate subject designed to help students
  gradually build an in-depth understanding of France. The course focuses on French
  attitudes and values regarding education, work, family and institutions, and deals
  with the differing notions that underlie interpersonal interactions and communication
  styles, such as politeness, friendship and formality. Using a Web comparative, cross-cultural
  approach, students explore a variety of French and American materials, then analyze
  and compare them using questionnaires, opinion polls, news reports (in different
  media), as well as a variety of historical, anthropological and literary texts.
  Throughout the course, attention is given to the development of relevant linguistics
  skills. This course is recommended for students planning to study and work in France
  and is taught in French.
