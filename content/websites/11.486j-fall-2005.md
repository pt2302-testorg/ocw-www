course_description: 'This course is designed for students particularly concerned with
  the practical problems of operating in large formal organizations, either from an
  operational or a research perspective. It will focus, as the title suggests, upon
  different forms of economic organizations and institutions in advanced and developing
  industrial societies and the theories (and theoretical perspectives) which might
  help us to understand them.
