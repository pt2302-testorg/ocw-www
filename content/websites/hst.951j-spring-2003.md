course_description: 'This course presents the main concepts of decision analysis,
  artificial intelligence and predictive model construction and evaluation in the
  specific context of medical applications. It emphasizes the advantages and disadvantages
  of using these methods in real-world systems and provides hands-on experience. Its
  technical focus is on decision support, knowledge-based systems (qualitative and
  quantitative), learning systems (including logistic regression, classification trees,
  neural networks, rough sets), and techniques to evaluate the performance of such
  systems. It reviews computer-based diagnosis, planning and monitoring of therapeutic
  interventions. It also discusses implemented medical applications and the software
  tools used in their construction. Students produce a final project using the machine
  learning methods learned in the course, based on actual clinical data.
