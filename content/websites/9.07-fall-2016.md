course_description: 'Provides students with the basic tools for analyzing experimental
  data, properly interpreting statistical reports in the literature, and reasoning
  under uncertain situations. Topics organized around three key theories: Probability,
  statistical, and the linear model. Probability theory covers axioms of probability,
  discrete and continuous probability models, law of large numbers, and the Central
  Limit Theorem. Statistical theory covers estimation, likelihood theory, Bayesian
  methods, bootstrap and other Monte Carlo methods, as well as hypothesis testing,
  confidence intervals, elementary design of experiments principles and goodness-of-fit.
  The linear model theory covers the simple regression model and the analysis of variance.
  Places equal emphasis on theory, data analyses, and simulation studies.
