course_description: 'After decades of efforts to promote development, why is there
  so much poverty in the world? What are some of the root causes of inequality world-wide
  and why do poverty, economic transformations and development policies often have
  different consequences for women and men? This course explores these issues while
  also examining the history of development itself, its underlying assumptions, and
  its range of supporters and critics. It considers the various meanings given to
  development by women and men, primarily as residents of particular regions, but
  also as aid workers, policy makers and government officials. In considering how
  development projects and policies are experienced in daily life in urban and rural
  areas in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Melanesia, this course asks what are the
  underlying political, economic, social, and gender dynamics that make "development"
  an ongoing problem world-wide.
