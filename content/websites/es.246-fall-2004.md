course_description: 'The goal of this seminar is to have open discussions of controversial
  political and social issues and raise awareness of current world events in an informal
  setting. Discussions for the first part of each class will focus on current events
  from that week, while in the second part of class students will discuss a scheduled
  issue in greater detail. Scheduled issues include the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
  the regulation of marijuana, how our society should punish criminals, genocide in
  Rwanda and Sudan, discrimination in our society today, the future of social security,
  whether pornography is sexist, and where we can go from here in the Arab/Israeli
  Conflict. Discussions will be supplemented by readings, films, and public speakers.
  Students will also be encouraged to read news media from around the world.
