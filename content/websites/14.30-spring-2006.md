course_description: This course is a self-contained introduction to statistics with
  economic applications. Elements of probability theory, sampling theory, statistical
  estimation, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing. It uses elementary econometrics
  and other applications of statistical tools to economic data. It also provides a
  solid foundation in probability and statistics for economists and other social scientists.
  We will emphasize topics needed in the further study of econometrics and provide
  basic preparation for [_14.32 Econometrics_](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-32-econometrics-spring-2007/index.htm).
  No prior preparation in probability and statistics is required, but familiarity
  with basic algebra and calculus is assumed.
