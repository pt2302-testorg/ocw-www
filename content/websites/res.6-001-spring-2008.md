course_description: 'Published in 1989 by Prentice-Hall, this book is a useful resource
  for educators and self-learners alike. The text is aimed at those who have seen
  Maxwell''s equations in integral and differential form and who have been exposed
  to some integral theorems and differential operators. A hypertext version of this
  textbook can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/6.013_book/www/book.html). An accompanying
  set of video demonstrations is available below.


  These video demonstrations convey electromagnetism concepts. The demonstrations
  are related to topics covered in the textbook. They were prepared by Markus Zahn,
  James R. Melcher, and Manuel L. Silva and were produced by the Department of Electrical
  Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


  The purpose of these demonstrations is to make mathematical analysis of electromagnetism
  take on physical meaning. Based on relatively simple configurations and arrangements
  of equipment, they make a direct connection between what has been analytically derived
  and what is observed. They permit the student to observe physically what has been
  described symbolically. Often presented with a plot of theoretical predictions that
  are compared to measured data, these demonstrations give the opportunity to test
  the range of validity of the theory and present a quantitative approach to dealing
  with the physical world.


  The short form of these videos contains the demonstrations only. The long form also
  presents theory, diagrams, and calculations in support of the demonstrations.


  These videos are used in the courses [6.013/ESD.013J](/courses/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009/)
  and [6.641](/courses/6-641-electromagnetic-fields-forces-and-motion-spring-2009/).
