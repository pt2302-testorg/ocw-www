course_description: 'This course is an introduction to designing mechatronic systems,
  which require integration of the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines
  within a unified framework. There are significant laboratory-based design experiences.
  Topics covered in the course include: Low-level interfacing of software with hardware;
  use of high-level graphical programming tools to implement real-time computation
  tasks; digital logic; analog interfacing and power amplifiers; measurement and sensing;
  electromagnetic and optical transducers; control of mechatronic systems.
