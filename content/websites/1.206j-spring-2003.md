course_description: 'Explores a variety of models and optimization techniques for
  the solution of airline schedule planning and operations problems. Schedule design,
  fleet assignment, aircraft maintenance routing, crew scheduling, passenger mix,
  and other topics are covered. Recent models and algorithms addressing issues of
  model integration, robustness, and operations recovery are introduced. Modeling
  and solution techniques designed specifically for large-scale problems, and state-of-the-art
  applications of these techniques to airline problems are detailed.
