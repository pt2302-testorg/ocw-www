course_description: "Hacking and trolling; mass murders and bullying. What do these\
  \ have in common? One theory holds that these are all \"deviant\" social behaviors,\
  \ occurring both online and off, which have purportedly been brought about or exacerbated\
  \ by our new media environment. Such aberrant behaviors seemingly give us ample\
  \ reason to fear digital and social media. But is technology to blame? We will grapple\
  \ with this question as we investigate how our understanding of new technologies\
  \ and media is socially shaped and, in turn, how new media might influence our social\
  \ behavior.\n\nWe will begin by studying how similar panics about \"old\" media\
  \ (books, film, television and even the written word itself) set historical precedents\
  \ for these current fears. Along the way we will establish and explore issues embedded\
  \ in debates about new media, including questions of class, gender, youth, sex,\
  \ and violence. Such topics will be placed in cross-cultural perspective, allowing\
  \ us to compare the nature of panics over contemporary events and issues\u2014e.g.\
  \ the Columbine school shootings, cyber-bullying, Japanese otaku, and the Chinese\
  \ \"Human Flesh Search Engine\"\u2014occurring within both the United States and\
  \ East Asia. Students will read essays, keep media journals and watch films pertaining\
  \ to weekly topics.\n"
