course_description: 'This course forms the intermediate level of what constitutes
  a four-term foundation in Mandarin. Upon completion of Chinese III and IV, students
  should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy
  level of 700 characters (approximately 2000 common words written in both traditional
  and simplified characters), read materials in simple standard written Chinese, and
  produce both orally and in writing short compositions on everyday topics. Throughout
  the course we will address issues of how cultural differences inform and are informed
  by different linguistic contexts and practices.
