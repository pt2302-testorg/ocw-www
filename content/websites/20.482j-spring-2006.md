course_description: 'This subject describes and illustrates computational approaches
  to solving problems in systems biology. A series of case-studies will be explored
  that demonstrate how an effective match between the statement of a biological problem
  and the selection of an appropriate algorithm or computational technique can lead
  to fundamental advances. The subject will cover several discrete and numerical algorithms
  used in simulation, feature extraction, and optimization for molecular, network,
  and systems models in biology.
