course_description: 'This course examines some leading examples of major genres of
  storytelling in the Western tradition, among them epic (Homer''s _Odyssey_), romance
  (from the Arthurian tradition), and novel (Cervantes''s _Don Quixote_). We will
  be asking why people tell (and have always told) stories, how they tell them, why
  they might tell them the way they do, and what difference it makes how they tell
  them. We''ll combine an investigation of the changing formal properties of narratives
  with consideration of the historical, cultural, and technological factors that have
  influenced how tales got told. In keeping with its CI-H and HASS-D label, this course
  will involve substantial attention to students'' writing and speaking abilities.
