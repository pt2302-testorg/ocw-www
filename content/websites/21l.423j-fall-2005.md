course_description: 'This course examines the production, transmission, preservation
  and qualities of folk music in the British Isles and North America from the 18th
  century to the folk revival of the 1960s and the present. There is a special emphasis
  on balladry, fiddle styles, and African-American influences. The class sings ballads
  and folk songs from the Child and Lomax collections as well as other sources as
  we examine them from literary, historical, and musical points of view. Readings
  supply critical and background materials from a number of sources. Visitors and
  films bring additional perspectives.
