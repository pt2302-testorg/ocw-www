course_description: "This course looks at the history of avant-garde and electronic\
  \ music from the early twentieth century to the present. The class is organized\
  \ as a theory and production seminar for which students may either produce audio/multimedia\
  \ projects or a research paper. It engages music scholarship, cultural criticism,\
  \ studio production, and multi-media development, such as recent software, sound\
  \ design for film and games, and sound installation. Sound as a media tool for communication\
  \ and sound as a form of artistic expression are subjects under discussion. The\
  \ artists' work reviewed in the course includes selections from audio innovators\
  \ such as the Italian Futurists, Edgard Var\xE8se, John Cage, King Tubby, Brian\
  \ Eno, Steve Reich, Afrika Bambaataa, Kraftwerk, Merzbow, Aphex Twin, Rza, Bj\xF6\
  rk, and others.\n"
