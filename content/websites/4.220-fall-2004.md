course_description: 'This class presents an analysis of the development of housing
  models and their urban implications in Paris, London, and New York City from the
  seventeenth century to the present. The focus will be on three models: the French
  hotel, the London row house, and the New York City tenement and apartment building.
  Other topics covered will include twentieth-century housing reform movements and
  work by the London County Council, CIAM, and American public housing agencies.
