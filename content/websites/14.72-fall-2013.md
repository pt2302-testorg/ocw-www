course_description: 'This course addresses the evolution of the modern capitalist
  economy and evaluates its current structure and performance. Various paradigms of
  economics are contrasted and compared (neoclassical, Marxist, socioeconomic, and
  neocorporate) in order to understand how modern capitalism has been shaped and how
  it functions in today''s economy. The course stresses general analytic reasoning
  and problem formulation rather than specific analytic techniques. Readings include
  classics in economic thought as well as contemporary analyses.
