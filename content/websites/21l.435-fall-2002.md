course_description: 'Filmed Shakespeare began in 1899, with Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree
  performing the death scene from King John for the camera. Sarah Bernhardt, who had
  played Hamlet a number of times in her long career, filmed the duel scene for the
  Paris Exposition of 1900. In the era of silent film (1895-1929) several hundred
  Shakespeare films were made in England, France Germany and the United States, Even
  without the spoken word, Shakespeare was popular in the new medium. The first half-century
  of sound included many of the most highly regarded Shakespeare films, among them
  -- Laurence Olivier''s Hamlet and Henry V, Orson Welles'' Othello and Chimes at
  Midnight, Kurosawa''s Throne of Blood, Polanski''s Macbeth and Zeffirelli''s Romeo
  and Juliet. We are now in the midst of an extremely rich and varied period for Shakespeare
  on film which began with the release of Kenneth Branagh''s Henry V in 1989 and includes
  such films as Richard Loncraine''s Richard III, Julie Taymor''s Titus, Zeffirelli
  and Almereyda''s Hamlet films, Baz Luhrmann''s William Shakespeare''s Romeo + Juliet,
  and Shakespeare in Love. The phenomenon of filmed Shakespeare raises many questions
  for literary and media studies about adaptation, authorship, the status of "classic"
  texts and their variant forms, the role of Shakespeare in youth and popular culture,
  and the transition from manuscript, book and stage to the modern medium of film
  and its recent digitally inflected forms.


  Most of our work will involve individual and group analysis of the "film text" --
  that is, of specific sequences in the films, aided by videotape, DVD, the [Shakespeare
  Electronic Archive](http://shea.mit.edu/), and some of the software tools for video
  annoatation developed by the MIT Shakespeare Project under the [MIT-Microsoft iCampus
  Initiative](http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/projects/i-campus/).


  We will study the films as works of art in their own right, and try to understand
  the means -- literary, dramatic, performative, cinematic -- by which they engage
  audiences and create meaning. With Shakespeare film as example, we will discuss
  how stories cross time, culture and media, and reflect on the benefits as well as
  the limitations of such migration.


  The class will be conducted as a structured discussion, punctuated by student presentations
  and "mini-lectures" by the instructor. Students will introduce discussions, prepare
  clips and examples, and the major "written" work will take the form of presentations
  to the class and multimedia annotations as well as conventional short essays.


  The methodological bias of the class is close "reading" of both text and film. This
  is a class in which your insights will form a major part of the work and will be
  the basis of a large fraction of class discussion. You will need to read carefully,
  to watch and listen to the films carefully, and develop effective ways of conveying
  your ideas to the class.
