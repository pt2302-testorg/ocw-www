course_description: "This course explores languages that have been deliberately constructed,\
  \ including Esperanto, Klingon, and Tolkien's Elvish. Students construct their own\
  \ languages while considering the basic linguistic characteristics of various languages\
  \ of the world. Through regular assignments, students describe the\_phonology, morphology,\
  \ syntax, semantics, and writing system of their\_constructed language. The final\
  \ assignment is a grammatical description of the new language.\n"
