course_description: 'This class addresses the representation, analysis, and design
  of discrete time signals and systems. The major concepts covered include: Discrete-time
  processing of continuous-time signals; decimation, interpolation, and sampling rate
  conversion; flowgraph structures for DT systems; time-and frequency-domain design
  techniques for recursive (IIR) and non-recursive (FIR) filters; linear prediction;
  discrete Fourier transform, FFT algorithm; short-time Fourier analysis and filter
  banks; multirate techniques; Hilbert transforms; Cepstral analysis and various applications.

  I would like to express my thanks to **Thomas Baran**, **Myung Jin Choi**, and **Xiaomeng
  Shi** for compiling the lecture notes on this site from my individual lectures and
  handouts and their class notes during the semesters that they were students in the
  course. These lecture notes, the text book and included problem sets and solutions
  will hopefully be helpful as you learn and explore the topic of Discrete-Time Signal
  Processing.
