course_description: 'This course focuses on an exploration of the role that communication
  plays in the work of the contemporary engineering and science professional. Emphasis
  is placed on analyzing how composition and publication contribute to work management
  and knowledge production, as well as the "how-to" aspects of writing specific kinds
  of documents in a clear style. Topics include: communication as organizational process,
  electronic modes such as e-mail and the Internet, the informational and social roles
  of specific document forms, writing as collaboration, the writing process, the elements
  of style, methods of oral presentation, and communication ethics. Case studies used
  as the basis for class discussion and some writing assignments. Several short documents,
  a longer report or article, and a short oral presentation are required.'
