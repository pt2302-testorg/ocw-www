course_description: "Traditionally, progress in electronics has been driven by miniaturization.\
  \ But as electronic devices approach the molecular scale, classical models for device\
  \ behavior must be abandoned. To prepare for the next generation of electronic devices,\
  \ this class teaches the theory of current, voltage and resistance from atoms up.\
  \ To describe electrons at the nanoscale, we will begin with an introduction to\
  \ the principles of quantum mechanics, including quantization, the wave-particle\
  \ duality, wavefunctions and Schr\xF6dinger's equation. Then we will consider the\
  \ electronic properties of molecules, carbon nanotubes and crystals, including energy\
  \ band formation and the origin of metals, insulators and semiconductors. Electron\
  \ conduction will be taught beginning with ballistic transport and concluding with\
  \ a derivation of Ohm's law. We will then compare ballistic to bulk MOSFETs. The\
  \ class will conclude with a discussion of possible fundamental limits to computation.\n"
