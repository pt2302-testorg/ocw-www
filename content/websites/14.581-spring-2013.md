course_description: 'This course covers, with a focus on both theory and empirics,
  advanced topics in international trade (as well as inter-regional trade and economic
  geography.) It includes the study of positive issues, such as: Why do countries
  trade? What goods do countries trade? What are the implications of openness for
  the location of production, industries, occupations, and innovative activity? And,
  what impedes trade and why do some countries deliberately erect policy impediments
  to trade? The course also concerns normative issues, such as: Is trade openness
  beneficial to a representative agent? And, are there winners and losers from trade
  and if so, can we identify them? Throughout, these issues are approached in neoclassical
  settings as well as those with market failures, at the industry-level as well as
  the firm-level, and in the presence of both mobile and immobile factors (e.g., FDI,
  offshoring of tasks, multinational firms and immigration).
