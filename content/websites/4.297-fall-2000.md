course_description: 'The course investigates e-Learning systems from a business, policy,
  technical and legal perspective. The issues presented will be tackled by discussion
  of the design and structure of the various example systems. The connection between
  information architectures and the physical workplace of the users will also be examined.
  The course will be comprised of readings, discussions, guest speakers and group
  design sessions. Laboratory sessions will be focused on implementation tools and
  opportunities to create one''s own working prototypes. Students will learn to describe
  information architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (used to specify,
  design and structure web applications) and XML (to designate meaningful content).
