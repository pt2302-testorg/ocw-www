course_description: 'We are now at an unprecedented point in the field of neuroscience:
  We can watch the human brain in action as it sees, thinks, decides, reads, and remembers.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the only method that enables us
  to monitor local neural activity in the normal human brain in a noninvasive fashion
  and with good spatial resolution. A large number of far-reaching and fundamental
  questions about the human mind and brain can now be answered using straightforward
  applications of this technology. This is particularly true in the area of high-level
  vision, the study of how we interpret and use visual information including object
  recognition, mental imagery, visual attention, perceptual awareness, visually guided
  action, and visual memory.


  The goals of this course are to help students become savvy and critical readers
  of the current neuroimaging literature, to understand the strengths and weaknesses
  of the technique, and to design their own cutting-edge, theoretically motivated
  studies. Students will read, present to the class, and critique recently published
  neuroimaging articles, as well as write detailed proposals for experiments of their
  own. Lectures will cover the theoretical background on some of the major areas in
  high-level vision, as well as an overview of what fMRI has taught us and can in
  future teach us about each of these topics. Lectures and discussions will also cover
  fMRI methods and experimental design. A prior course in statistics and at least
  one course in perception or cognition are required.
