course_description: '6.0002 is the continuation of _[6.0001 Introduction to Computer
  Science and Programming in Python](/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)_
  and is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to
  provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving
  problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident
  of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
  The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.
