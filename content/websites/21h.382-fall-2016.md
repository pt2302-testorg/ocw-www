course_description: "The decades leading up to the Atlantic revolutions of the late\
  \ eighteenth century were formative moments in the rise of capitalism. The novel\
  \ instruments of credit, debt, and investment fashioned during this period proved\
  \ to be enduring sources of financial innovation, but they also generated a great\
  \ deal of political conflict, particularly during the revolutionary era itself.\
  \ \_This seminar examines the debates surrounding large-scale financial and trading\
  \ corporations and considers the eighteenth century as a period of recurring financial\
  \ crisis in which corporate power came into sustained and direct contact with emerging\
  \ republican norms. The seminar ends with a look at the relationship between slavery\
  \ and the rise of \u201Cmodern\u201D or \u201Cindustrial\u201D capitalism in the\
  \ nineteenth century, as well as some of the critiques of capitalism that emerged\
  \ out of that experience.\n"
