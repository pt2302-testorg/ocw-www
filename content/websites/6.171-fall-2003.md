course_description: "6.171\_is a course for students who already have some programming\
  \ and software engineering experience. The goal is to give students some experience\
  \ in dealing with those challenges that are unique to Internet applications, such\
  \ as:\n\n*   concurrency;\n*   unpredictable load;\n*   security risks;\n*   opportunity\
  \ for wide-area distributed computing;\n*   creating a reliable and stateful user\
  \ experience on top of unreliable connections and stateless protocols;\n*   extreme\
  \ requirements and absurd development schedules;\n*   requirements that change mid-way\
  \ through a project, sometimes because of experience gained from testing with users;\n\
  *   user demands for a multi-modal interface.\n"
