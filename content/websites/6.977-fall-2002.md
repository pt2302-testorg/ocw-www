course_description: '6.977 focuses on the physics of the interaction of photons with
  semiconductor materials. The band theory of solids is used to calculate the absorption
  and gain of semiconductor media. The rate equation formalism is used to develop
  the concepts of laser threshold, population inversion and modulation response. Matrix
  methods and coupled mode theory are applied to resonator structures such as distributed
  feedback lasers, tunable lasers and microring devices. The course is also intended
  to introduce students to noise models for semiconductor devices and to applications
  of optoelectronic devices to fiber optic communications. This course is worth 12
  Engineering Design points.
