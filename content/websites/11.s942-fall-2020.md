course_description: "In this seminar we explore the history, present, and future of\
  \ psychogeography, hoping to map the center and the edges of this elusive field\
  \ and to pioneer potential new directions and applications for the principles we\
  \ discover (or invent) along the way. We discuss classic and more recent texts\u2014\
  including novels, essays, poems, reviews, films, and other works of creative nonfiction\
  \ and speculative fiction. Students also undertake their own psychogeographic wanderings\
  \ and complete a final \u201Ccarto-imagino-synthetic\u201D project to document,\
  \ describe, map, and otherwise \u201Cmake sense of place\u201D through these techniques.\n"
