course_description: "Roman Literature of the Golden Age of Augustus Caesar, produced\
  \ during the transition from Republican to Imperial forms of government, was to\
  \ have a profound and defining influence on Western European and American societies.\_\
  These writings ultimately established lasting models of aesthetic refinement, philosophical\
  \ aspiration, and political ambition that continue to shape modern cultures.\_This\
  \ class will be exploring the Golden Age of Latin Literature from an historical\
  \ perspective in order to provide an intensive examination of the cultural contexts\
  \ in which these monumental works of classical art were first produced.\_Readings\
  \ will emphasize the transition from a Republican form of government to an Empire\
  \ under the rule of Augustus Caesar and the diversity of responses among individual\
  \ authors to the profound structural changes that Roman society was undergoing at\
  \ this time. Particular attention will be devoted to the reorganization of society\
  \ and the self through textuality, the changing dimensions of the public and the\
  \ private, the roles of class and gender, and the relationship between art and pleasure.\_\
  Writings covering a wide variety of literary genres will include the works of Caesar,\
  \ Cicero, Catullus, Livy, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, with additional readings from\
  \ Cassius Dio for background.\n"
