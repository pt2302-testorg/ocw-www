course_description: 'This class explores the political and aesthetic foundations of
  hip hop. Students trace the musical, corporeal, visual, spoken word, and literary
  manifestations of hip hop over its 30 year presence in the American cultural imagery.
  Students also investigate specific black cultural practices that have given rise
  to its various idioms. Students create material culture related to each thematic
  section of the course. Scheduled work in performance studio helps students understand
  how hip hop is created and assessed.
