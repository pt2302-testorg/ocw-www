course_description: 'This course introduces students to the techniques of participatory
  action research (PAR) and the practice of case study research. PAR processes are
  place or case-specific, place a premium on local ways of knowing, and gauge the
  success of research in terms of what partner-communities do with the knowledge that
  is co-produced. The objective of PAR is to generate the ideas, information, and
  understandings that ought to inform efforts to promote social change. By focusing
  on ways of co-producing knowledge using various forms of data collection and analysis,
  students will learn how the people and communities who are often university partners
  in applied social science research can use findings or results from PAR case studies
  to address the challenges they confront in their communities.
