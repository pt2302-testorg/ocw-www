course_description: This course offers analysis and practice of various forms of scientific
  and technical writing, from memos to journal articles, in addition to strategies
  for conveying technical information to specialist and non-specialist audiences.
  Comparable to [*21W.780 Communicating in Technical Organizations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/21w-780-communicating-in-technical-organizations-fall-2001/),
  but methods in this course are designed to deal with special problems of advanced
  ELS or bilingual students. The goal of the workshop is to develop effective writing
  skills for academic and professional contexts. Models, materials, topics and assignments
  vary from term to term.
