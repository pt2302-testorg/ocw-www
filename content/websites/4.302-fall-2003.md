course_description: 'This class offers a foundation in the visual art practice and
  its critical analysis for beginning architecture students. Emphasis is on long-range
  artistic development and its analogies to architectural thinking and practice. Students
  will learn to communicate ideas and experiences through various two-dimensional,
  and three-dimensional, and time-based media, including installations, performance
  and video. Lectures, visiting artist presentations, field trips, and readings supplement
  studio practice.
