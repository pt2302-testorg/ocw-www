course_description: 'This course introduces students to a quantitative approach to
  studying the problems of physiological adaptation in altered environments, especially
  microgravity and partial gravity environments. The course curriculum starts with
  an Introduction and Selected Topics, which provides background information on the
  physiological problems associated with human space flight, as well as reviewing
  terminology and key engineering concepts. Then curriculum modules on Bone Mechanics,
  Muscle Mechanics, Musculoskeletal Dynamics and Control, and the Cardiovascular System
  are presented. These modules start out with qualitative and biological information
  regarding the system and its adaptation, and progresses to a quantitative endpoint
  in which engineering methods are used to analyze specific problems and countermeasures.
  Additional course curriculum focuses on interdisciplinary topics, suggestions include
  extravehicular activity and life support. The final module consists of student term
  project work.
