course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to the major popular music
  cultures of the Chinese-speaking world. We will consider a wide variety of genres,
  from Shanghainese shidaiqu to Cantopop to Taiwanese rap, with the goal of listening
  beyond the notion of a monolithic "Chinese popular music" to something more dynamic,
  multivocal, and translocal. We will ask: What, if anything, is so "Chinese" about
  Chinese popular music? How does popular music participate in the formation of identities
  for artists and audiences in these areas? How does it enable the articulation of
  diverging social and political values while also facilitating meaningful connections
  among disparate communities? We will approach these questions through a diverse
  array of source materials, including sound recordings, music videos, films, and
  online multimedia.
