course_description: "Introduction to Design Inquiry explores the nature and exercise\
  \ of design intelligence. It aims to open avenues for further research and, along\
  \ them, to open vistas on the teaching of design and on more mindful professional\
  \ design practices.\n\nWe see design as processes located in individuals and groups,\
  \ shaped by the formation and experience of each individual and by the characteristics\
  \ of the groups that play a role in the design process. People construct the worlds\
  \ they inhabit out of what they know and have experienced. So also does the designer,\
  \ but the designer\u2019s worlds must be possible for others to inhabit and, therefore,\
  \ to construct. Indeed the success of a design depends in large part on the degree\
  \ to which these constructive processes yield similar results.\n"
