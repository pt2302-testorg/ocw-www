course_description: This course is designed to help you develop skills that will enable
  you to produce clear and effective scientific and technical documents. We will focus
  on basic principles of good writing-which scientific and technical writing shares
  with other forms of writing-and on types of documents common in scientific and technical
  fields and organizations. While the emphasis will be on writing, oral communication
  of scientific and technical information will form an important component of the
  course, as well.
