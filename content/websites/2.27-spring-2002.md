course_description: 'Turbulent flows, with emphasis on engineering methods. Governing
  equations for momentum, energy, and species transfer.


  Turbulence: its production, dissipation, and scaling laws. Reynolds averaged equations
  for momentum, energy, and species transfer. Simple closure approaches for free and
  bounded turbulent shear flows. Applications to jets, pipe and channel flows, boundary
  layers, buoyant plumes and thermals, and Taylor dispersion, etc., including heat
  and species transport as well as flow fields. Introduction to more complex closure
  schemes, including the k-epsilon, and statistical methods in turbulence.
