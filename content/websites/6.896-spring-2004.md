course_description: "6.896\_covers mathematical foundations of parallel hardware,\
  \ from computer arithmetic to physical design, focusing on algorithmic underpinnings.\
  \ Topics covered include: arithmetic circuits, parallel prefix, systolic arrays,\
  \ retiming, clocking methodologies, boolean logic, sorting networks, interconnection\
  \ networks, hypercubic networks, P-completeness, VLSI layout theory, reconfigurable\
  \ wiring, fat-trees, and area-time complexity.\n\nThis course was also taught as\
  \ part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/) (SMA) programme\
  \ as course number SMA 5511 (Theory of Parallel Hardware).\n"
