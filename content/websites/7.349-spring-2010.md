course_description: 'Like transistors in a computer, synapses perform complex computations
  and connect the brain''s non-linear processing elements (neurons) into a functional
  circuit. Understanding the role of synapses in neuronal computation is essential
  to understanding how the brain works. In this course students will be introduced
  to cutting-edge research in the field of synaptic neurophysiology. The course will
  cover such topics as synapse formation, synaptic function, synaptic plasticity,
  the roles of synapses in higher cognitive processes and how synaptic dysfunction
  can lead to disease.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
