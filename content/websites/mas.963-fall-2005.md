course_description: 'This course explores the potential impact of modern technologies
  on the school reforms debate. The first part of the course provides an overview
  of the current state of the school reform debate and reviews the ideas in the progressive
  school reform movement, as well as examining the new public charter school in Cambridge
  as a case study. The second part of the course requires critical study of research
  projects that hold promise as inspirations and guidelines for concrete multidisciplinary
  activities and curriculum for progressive charter schools. The course concludes
  with a discussion of the challenges in scaling the successful innovations in school
  reform to new contexts.
