course_description: 'This course is a requirement for completion of the Urban Design
  Certificate Program. It investigates the complex nature of ''successful'' urban
  design and attempts to identify and evaluate examples of urban design that are at
  the leading edge of practice, anticipating the future. The seminar will deal with
  two parallel questions: what are the key trends that will shape the future form
  and function of cities, and how will these changes affect the role of the urban
  designer? The first part of the seminar focuses on the present, and the second part
  of the semester will consider the future. After the course surveys the landscape
  of contemporary urban design practice, the challenge it will pose to students will
  be to identify the trajectory of cities and city design from both physical and social
  perspectives.
