  \ and literature, studying works linked across the two media by genre, topic, and\
  \ style. It aims to sharpen appreciation of major works of cinema and of literary\

  \ and aesthetic boundaries. It includes some attention to theory of narrative. Films\
  \ to be studied include works by Akira Kurosawa, John Ford, Francis Ford Coppolla,\
  \ Clint Eastwood, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, and Federico Fellini, among others.\
  \ Literary works include texts by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Cervantes,\
