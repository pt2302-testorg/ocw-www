course_description: "The [MIT Governance Lab](https://mitgovlab.org/) (MIT GOV/LAB)\
  \ is an applied research group and ideas incubator that aims to improve democracy\
  \ and governance by changing practice around corruption, government accountability,\
  \ and citizen voice. Our model combines behavioral political science, experimental\
  \ social science, design thinking, and evaluation to iterate on governance solutions\
  \ that support people\u2019s ability to hold the government to account.\_\n\nWe\
  \ partner with in-country practitioners, including government, civil society, and\
  \ social enterprises, at every stage of the research and learning process, from\
  \ theory building to theory testing, to critical reflections and adaptations in\
  \ real time, with the goal of contributing to a solid evidence base to strengthen\
  \ the overall field of practice for participatory governance.\_\n\nTo learn more\
  \ about our work, check out our latest [updates](https://mitgovlab.org/news/), tools,\
  \ guides, and other [resources](https://mitgovlab.org/resources/), as well as published\
  \ [research](https://mitgovlab.org/research/), or be in touch [mitgovlab@mit.edu](mailto:mitgovlab@mit.edu)."
