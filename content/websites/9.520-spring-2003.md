course_description: 'Focuses on the problem of supervised learning from the perspective
  of modern statistical learning theory starting with the theory of multivariate function
  approximation from sparse data. Develops basic tools such as Regularization including
  Support Vector Machines for regression and classification. Derives generalization
  bounds using both stability and VC theory. Discusses topics such as boosting and
  feature selection. Examines applications in several areas: computer vision, computer
  graphics, text classification and bioinformatics. Final projects and hands-on applications
  and exercises are planned, paralleling the rapidly increasing practical uses of
  the techniques described in the subject.
