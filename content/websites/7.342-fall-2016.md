course_description: 'In this course, we will investigate the diverse types and functions
  of different RNA species, with a focus on "non-coding RNAs," i.e. those that do
  not directly encode proteins. The course will convey both the exciting discoveries
  in and frontiers of RNA research that are propelling our understanding of cell biology
  as well as the intellectual and experimental approaches responsible.


  The molecular biology revolution firmly established the role of DNA as the primary
  carrier of genetic information and proteins as the primary effector molecules of
  the cell. The intermediate between DNA and proteins is RNA, which initially was
  regarded as the "molecule in the middle" of the central dogma. This view has been
  transformed over the past two decades, as RNA has become recognized as a critical
  regulator of cellular processes.
