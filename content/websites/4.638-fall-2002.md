course_description: 'The aim of this course is to highlight some technical aspects
  of the classical tradition in architecture that have so far received only sporadic
  attention. It is well known that quantification has always been an essential component
  of classical design: proportional systems in particular have been keenly investigated.
  But the actual technical tools whereby quantitative precision was conceived, represented,
  transmitted, and implemented in pre-modern architecture remain mostly unexplored.
  By showing that a dialectical relationship between architectural theory and data-processing
  technologies was as crucial in the past as it is today, this course hopes to promote
  a more historically aware understanding of the current computer-induced transformations
  in architectural design.
