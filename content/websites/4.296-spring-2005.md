course_description: 'Furniture making is in many ways like bridge building, connections
  holding posts apart with spans to support a deck. Many architects have tried their
  hand at furniture design, Wright, Mies Van Der Rohe, Aalto, Saarinen, Le Corbusier,
  and Gerhy.


  We will review the history of furniture making in America with a visit to the Decorative
  Arts Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and have Cambridge artist/craftsman
  Mitch Ryerson show us his work and talk about design process. Students will learn
  traditional woodworking techniques beginning with the use of hand tools, power tools
  and finally woodworking machines.


  Students will build a single piece of furniture of an original design that must
  support someone weighing 185 lbs. sitting on it 12 inches off the ground made primarily
  of wood. Students should expect to spend approximately 80 hours in the shop outside
  of class time.


  Preregistered architecture students will get first priority but first meeting attendance
  is mandatory. Twelve student maximum, no exceptions.
