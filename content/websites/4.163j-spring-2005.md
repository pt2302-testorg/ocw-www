course_description: "This studio discusses in great detail the design of urban environments,\
  \ specifically in Providence, RI. It will propose strategies for change in large\
  \ areas of cities, to be developed over time, involving different actors. Fitting\
  \ forms into natural, man-made, historical, and cultural contexts; enabling desirable\
  \ activity patterns; conceptualizing built form; providing infrastructure and service\
  \ systems; guiding the sensory character of development: all are topics covered\
  \ in the studio.\_The course\_integrates architecture and planning students in joint\
  \ work and requires individual designs and planning guidelines as a final product.\n"
