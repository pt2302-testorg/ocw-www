course_description: 'Regenerative medicine involves the repair and regeneration of
  tissues for therapeutic purposes, such as replacing bone marrow in leukemia, cartilage
  in osteoarthritis or cells of the heart after a heart attack.


  In this course, we will explore basic mechanisms of how cells differentiate into
  specific tissues in response to a variety of biologic signaling molecules. We will
  discuss the use of such factors for in vitro tissue production. We will also study
  the cellular mechanisms involved in the cloning of animals and how Scottish researchers
  produced the sheep Dolly using the nucleus of a mammary gland cell from an adult
  sheep. We will read papers describing organ production, such as the in vitro formation
  of beating heart cells. We will also consider the molecular bases of cellular tissue
  remodeling to correct these changes. We will discuss how studies of the developmental,
  cellular and molecular biology of regeneration have led to the discovery of new
  drugs.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
