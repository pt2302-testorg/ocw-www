course_description: "This workshop provides an introduction to urban environmental\
  \ design and explores the potential of information technology and the Internet to\
  \ transform public education, city design, and community development in inner-city\
  \ neighborhoods. Integration of comprehensive (\"top-down\") and grassroots (\"\
  bottom-up\") approaches to design and planning is a major theme.\n\nStudents will\
  \ work in a real neighborhood with real people on a real project, putting theory\
  \ into practice and reflecting on insights gained in the process. We will study\
  \ environmental and community history and devise designs for vacant land near a\
  \ middle school in West Philadelphia within the context of planning for the larger\
  \ community and watershed.\n\nThe class website can be found here:\_[Power of Place:\
  \ Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development](http://architecture.mit.edu/class/place/).\n"
