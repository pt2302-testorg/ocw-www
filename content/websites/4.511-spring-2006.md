course_description: 'This is an advanced subject in computer modeling and CAD CAM
  fabrication, with a focus on building large-scale prototypes and digital mock-ups
  within a classroom setting. Prototypes and mock-ups are developed with the aid of
  outside designers, consultants, and fabricators. Field trips and in-depth relationships
  with building fabricators demonstrate new methods for building design. The class
  analyzes complex shapes, shape relationships, and curved surfaces fabrication at
  a macro scale leading to new architectural languages, based on methods of construction.
