course_description: 'This course covers works by major American novelists, beginning
  with the late 18th century and concluding with a contemporary novelist. The class
  places major emphasis on reading novels as literary texts, but attention is paid
  to historical, intellectual, and political contexts as well. The syllabus varies
  from term to term, but many of the following writers are represented: Rowson, Hawthorne,
  Melville, Twain, Wharton, James, and Toni Morrison. Previously taught topics include
  The American Revolution and Makeovers (i.e. adaptations and reinterpretation of
  novels traditionally considered as American "Classics"). May be repeated for credit
  with instructor''s permission so long as the content differs.
