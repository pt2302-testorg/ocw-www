course_description: 'Ever hang your head in shame after your Python program wasn''t
  as fast as your friend''s C program? Ever wish you could use objects without having
  to use Java? Join us for this fun introduction to C and C++! We will take you through
  a tour that will start with writing simple C programs, go deep into the caves of
  C memory manipulation, resurface with an introduction to using C++ classes, dive
  deeper into advanced C++ class use and the C++ Standard Template Libraries. We''ll
  wrap up by teaching you some tricks of the trade that you may need for tech interviews.


  We see this as a "C/C++ empowerment" course: we want you to come away understanding


  1.  why you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably
  for performance reasons),

  2.  why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects), and

  3.  how to be useful in C and C++.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
