course_description: '18.311 Principles of Continuum Applied Mathematics covers fundamental
  concepts in continuous applied mathematics, including applications from traffic
  flow, fluids, elasticity, granular flows, etc. The class also covers continuum limit;
  conservation laws, quasi-equilibrium; kinematic waves; characteristics, simple waves,
  shocks; diffusion (linear and nonlinear); numerical solution of wave equations;
  finite differences, consistency, stability; discrete and fast Fourier transforms;
  spectral methods; transforms and series (Fourier, Laplace). Additional topics may
  include sonic booms, Mach cone, caustics, lattices, dispersion, and group velocity.
