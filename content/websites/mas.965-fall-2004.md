course_description: 'Millions of people are on-line today and the number is rapidly
  growing - yet this virtual crowd is often invisible. In this course we will examine
  ways of visualizing people, their activities and their interactions. Students will
  study the cognitive and cultural basis for social visualization through readings
  drawn from sociology, psychology and interface design and they will explore new
  ways of depicting virtual crowds and mapping electronic spaces through a series
  of design exercises.
