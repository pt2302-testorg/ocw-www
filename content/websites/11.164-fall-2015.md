course_description: 'This course provides a rigorous and critical introduction to
  the foundation, structure and operation of the international human rights movement,
  as it has evolved through the years and as it impacts the United States. The course
  introduces students to the key theoretical debates in the field including the historical
  origin and character of the modern idea of human rights, the debate between universality
  and cultural relativism, between civil and human rights, between individual and
  community, and the historically contentious relationship between the West and the
  Rest in matters of sovereignty and human rights, drawing on real life examples from
  current affairs.
