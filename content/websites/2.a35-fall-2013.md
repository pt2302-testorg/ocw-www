course_description: 'Biomimetics is based on the belief that nature, at least at times,
  is a good engineer. Biomimesis is the scientific method of learning new principles
  and processes based on systematic study, observation and experimentation with live
  animals and organisms. This Freshman Advising Seminar on the topic is a way for
  freshmen to explore some of MIT''s richness and learn more about what they may want
  to study in later years.
