course_description: 'This subject is the second semester of four that forms an introduction
  to modern standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin. The emphasis is on further
  developing students'' abilities to participate in simple, practical conversations
  on everyday topics as well as enhancing their abilities on reading and writing.
  The relationship between Chinese language and culture and the sociolinguistically
  appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. A typical class includes
  performance of memorized basic conversations, drills, questions and discussion,
  and various types of communicative exercises. At the end of this course, students
  are expected to develop an understanding of the language learning process so that
  they will be able to continue studying effectively on their own.
