course_description: 'This three-week module, centered on a focal case, represents
  the second part of the Department''s introduction to the challenges of reflection
  and action in professional planning practice. As such, it builds on the concepts
  and tools in 11.201 and 11.202 in the fall semester. Working in teams, students
  will deliver a 20-minute oral briefing, with an additional 10 minutes for questions
  and comments, in the last week of the class (as detailed on the assignment and posted
  course schedule). The teams will brief invited guests ("briefees") taking the roles
  of decision makers. DUSP faculty and fellow students may also be in attendance.
