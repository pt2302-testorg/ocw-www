course_description: 'The seminar will be devoted to understanding what we''re up to
  when we ascribe contents to a person''s assertions and mental attitudes. We seek
  to make clear the rules of the game for the philosophy of language. We''ll survey
  classic discussions of the issue by Field, Lewis and Stalnaker. But much of the
  emphasis of the class will be on getting clear about the limitations of our theoretical
  tools. I''d like to focus on places where our theorizing runs into trouble, or breaks
  down altogether.
