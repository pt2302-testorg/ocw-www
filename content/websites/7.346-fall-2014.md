course_description: 'The synapse is the fundamental element by which neurons transmit,
  receive and transform information in the brain. Synapses are functionally diverse,
  and a single neuron in the brain receives up to 10,000 synapses. Given the enormous
  complexity of the nervous system, how does a neuron integrate, encode and retrieve
  information? How is information processed beyond a single cell within the context
  of a neuronal circuit? Fundamental synaptic mechanisms underlie expression of higher-order
  brain functions, such as learning and memory, and cognition. Conversely, the disruption
  of synaptic processes contributes to the development of neurological disorders.
  In this course, students will learn to critically analyze the primary research literature
  to explore how synapses are studied and to understand how synapses integrate information
  to perform higher-order behavior.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
