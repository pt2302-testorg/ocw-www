course_description: 'This course is the second of the three parts of our graduate
  introduction to semantics. The others are _24.970 Introduction to Semantics_ and
  _24.954 Pragmatics in Linguistic Theory_. Like the other courses, this one is not
  meant as an overview of the field and its current developments. Our aim is to help
  you to develop the ability for semantic analysis, and we think that exploring a
  few topics in detail together with hands-on practical work is more effective than
  offering a bird''s-eye view of everything. Once you have gained some experience
  in doing semantic analysis, reading around in the many recent handbooks and in current
  issues of major journals and attending our seminars and colloquia will give you
  all you need to prosper. Because we want to focus, we need to make difficult choices
  as to which topics to cover.


  This year, we will focus on topics having to do with modality, conditionals, tense,
  and aspect.
