course_description: 'The Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) represents one of the most important
  physical and chemical discontinuities of the deep Earth as it separates the solid
  state, convective lower mantle from the liquid outer core. In this seminar course,
  the instructors will examine our current understanding of the CMB region from integrated
  seismological, mineral physics and geodynamical perspectives. Instructors will also
  introduce state-of-the-art methodologies that are employed to characterize the CMB
  region and relevant papers will be discussed in class. Topics will include CMB detection
  and topography, D'''' anisotropy, seismic velocity anomalies (e.g., ultra-low velocity
  zones), temperature, chemical reactions, phase relations, and mineral fabrications
  at the core-mantle boundary. These results will be integrated to address the CMB''s
  fundamental role in both mantle and core dynamics.
