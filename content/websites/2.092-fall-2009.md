course_description: 'This course introduces finite element methods for the analysis
  of solid, structural, fluid, field, and heat transfer problems. Steady-state, transient,
  and dynamic conditions are considered. Finite element methods and solution procedures
  for linear and nonlinear analyses are presented using largely physical arguments.
  The homework and a term project (for graduate students) involve use of the general
  purpose finite element analysis program [ADINA](http://www.adina.com/). Applications
  include finite element analyses, modeling of problems, and interpretation of numerical
  results.
