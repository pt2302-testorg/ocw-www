course_description: 'Mechanical forces play a decisive role during development of
  tissues and organs, during remodeling following injury as well as in normal function.
  A stress field influences cell function primarily through deformation of the extracellular
  matrix to which cells are attached. Deformed cells express different biosynthetic
  activity relative to undeformed cells. The unit cell process paradigm combined with
  topics in connective tissue mechanics form the basis for discussions of several
  topics from cell biology, physiology, and medicine.
