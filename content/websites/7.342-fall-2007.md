course_description: 'In this course we will explore the new emerging field of pathogen-induced
  chronic diseases. Work in this field has redefined the causes of some major disorders,
  such as ulcers. By reading the primary research literature we will learn about the
  molecular mechanisms through which pathogens cause disease. The diseases that we
  cover will be introduced with a short patient case study. We will discuss the bacterium
  Helicobacter pylori and gastric disease, HPV and cervical cancer, hepatitis C virus
  and liver disease, Epstein-Barr virus and lymphoma, Cytomegalovirus and atherosclerosis,
  as well as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. We will study technical advances in
  the fight against microbes and explore future directions for new treatment strategies
  of chronic infections and inflammation.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
