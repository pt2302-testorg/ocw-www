course_description: 'This course focuses on alternative ways in which the issues of
  growth, restructuring, innovation, knowledge, learning, and accounting and measurements
  can be examined, covering both industrialized and emerging countries. We give special
  emphasis to recent transformations in regional economies throughout the world and
  to the implications these changes have for the theories and research methods used
  in spatial economic analyses. Readings will relate mainly to the United States,
  but we cover pertinent material on foreign countries in lectures.
