course_description: 'For the last century, precepts of scientific management and administrative
  rationality have concentrated power in the hands of technical specialists, which
  in recent decades has contributed to widespread disenfranchisement and discontent
  among stakeholders in natural resources cases. In this seminar we examine the limitations
  of scientific management as a model both for governance and for gathering and using
  information, and describe alternative methods for informing and organizing decision-making
  processes. We feature cases involving large carnivores in the West (mountain lions
  and grizzly bears), Northeast coastal fisheries, and adaptive management of the
  Colorado River. There will be nightly readings and a short written assignment.
