course_description: 'This course examines cultural performances of Asia, including
  both traditional and contemporary forms, in a variety of genres. Students will explore
  the communicative power of performances with attention to the ways performers, media,
  cultural settings, and audiences interact. The representation of cultural difference
  is considered and how it is altered through processes of globalization. Performances
  are viewed live when possible, but the course also relies on video, audio, and online
  materials as necessary. There are no prerequisites for this course and it is taught
  in English.
