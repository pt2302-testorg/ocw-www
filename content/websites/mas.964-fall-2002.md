course_description: 'This course will explore the state of the art in common sense
  knowledge, and class projects will design and build interfaces that can exploit
  this knowledge to make more usable and helpful interfaces.


  Course requirements will consist of critiques of class readings (about 2 papers/week),
  and a final project (paper or computer implementation project). Grades will be based
  primarily on the projects, as well as a small component for class and online participation
