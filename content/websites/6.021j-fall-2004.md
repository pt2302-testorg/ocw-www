course_description: 'In this subject, we consider two basic topics in cellular biophysics,
  posed here as questions:


  1.  Which molecules are transported across cellular membranes, and what are the
  mechanisms of transport? How do cells maintain their compositions, volume, and membrane
  potential?

  2.  How are potentials generated across the membranes of cells? What do these potentials
  do?


  Although the questions posed are fundamentally biological questions, the methods
  for answering these questions are inherently multidisciplinary. As we will see throughout
  the course, the role of mathematical models is to express concepts precisely enough
  that precise conclusions can be drawn. In connection with all the topics covered,
  we will consider both theory and experiment. For the student, the educational value
  of examining the interplay between theory and experiment transcends the value of
  the specific knowledge gained in the subject matter.


  This course is jointly offered through four departments, available to both undergraduates
  and graduates.
