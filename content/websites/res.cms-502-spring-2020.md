course_description: "This course will help you develop an understanding of the characteristic\
  \ elements of competency-based education (CBE) and how schools are implementing\
  \ it. You will learn about CBE's potential for closing opportunity gaps, as well\
  \ as challenges and concerns. You will get a closer look at what the implementation\
  \ of CBE looks and feels like for students, teachers, administrators, families,\
  \ and community members. You will consider the kinds of system-wide shifts necessary\
  \ to support this innovation in education.\n\nBy looking at research and hearing\
  \ from experts and voices in schools, you will leave the course equipped to start\
  \ or continue conversations about whether CBE is a good fit in your context.\n\n\
  This course is part of the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use.\_You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling.\n"
