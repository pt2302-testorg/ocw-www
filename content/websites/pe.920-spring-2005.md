course_description: 'The sensing, thinking, moving body is the basis of our experience
  in the world; it is the very foundation on which cognitive intelligence is built.
  Physical Intelligence, then, is the inherent ability of the human organism to function
  in extraordinary accord with its physical environment. This class--a joint offering
  from the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER) and
  Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) for both PE and academic credit--uses
  the MIT gymnastics gym as a laboratory to explore Physical Intelligence as applied
  to Mechanical Engineering and design. Readings, discussions and experiential learning
  introduce various dimensions of Physical Intelligence which students then apply
  to the design of innovative exercise equipment.
