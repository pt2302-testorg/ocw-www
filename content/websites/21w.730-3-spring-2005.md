course_description: 'Environmentalists have traditionally relied upon the power of
  their prose to transform the thoughts and behavior of their contemporaries. In this
  class, we will do our best to follow in their footsteps. We will consider the strategies
  of popular science writers, lesser-known geologists, biologists, and hydrologists,
  and famous environmentalists. Students will have a chance to try out several ways
  of characterizing and explaining natural environments. Weekly writing exercises
  will help students develop and explore material for the longer papers.
