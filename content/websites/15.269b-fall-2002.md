course_description: 'Our subject is the ethics of leadership, an examination of the
  principles appealed to by executive authority when questions arise about its sources
  and its legitimacy. Most treatments of this subject resort to case-studies in order
  to illustrate the application of ethical principles to business situations, but
  our primary emphasis will be upon classic works of imaginative literature, which
  convey more directly than case-studies the ethical pressures of decision-making.
  Readings will include works by Shakespeare, Sophocles, Shaw, E.M. Forster, Joseph
  Conrad, George Orwell, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Henrik Ibsen, among others. Topics
  to be discussed include the sources of authority, the management of consensus, the
  ideal of vocation, the ethics of deception, the morality of expediency, the requirements
  of hierarchy, the virtues and vices of loyalty, the relevance of ethical principles
  in extreme situations.
