  literary texts (B. Brecht, S. Zweig) and contemporary media texts (film, TV broadcasts,
  Web materials). The emphasis is on discussion and exploration of cultural topics
  in their current social, political, and historical context via hypermedia documentaries.
  It also covers further refinement of oral and written expression and expansion of
  communicative competence in practical everyday situations.
