course_description: 'Recent years have seen an astonishing spread of democracy to
  many African, Asian, and Latin American countries. What caused these dramatic political
  transitions? What challenges do democratizing countries in the Third World face?
  Will these new democracies endure? We will take up these questions using film, fiction,
  and popular journalism, as well as scholarly research. We will also focus on a small
  number of countries (Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, and Sri
  Lanka) in order to explore in greater depth some of the most important political
  challenges faced by developing countries. Although the class focuses on the developing
  world, many of the lessons should "travel" to democratizing countries in other regions.
