course_description: 'This class focuses on reading a script theatrically with a view
  to mounting a coherent production. Through careful, intensive reading of a variety
  of plays from different periods and different aesthetics, a pattern emerges for
  discerning what options exist for interpretating a script. Students discuss the
  consequences of those options for production.
