course_description: 'This is a course focused on the literary genre of the essay,
  that wide-ranging, elastic, and currently very popular form that attracts not only
  nonfiction writers but also fiction writers, poets, scientists, physicians, and
  others to write in the form, and readers of every stripe to read it. Some say we
  are living in era in which the essay is enjoying a renaissance; certainly essays,
  both short and long, are at present easier to get published than are short stories
  or novels, and essays are featured regularly and prominently in the mainstream press
  (both magazines and newspapers) and on the _New York Times_ bestseller books list.
  But the essay has a history, too, a long one, which goes back at least to the sixteenth-century
  French writer Montaigne, generally considered the progenitor of the form. It will
  be our task, and I hope our pleasure, to investigate the possibilities of the essay
  together this semester, both by reading and by writing.
