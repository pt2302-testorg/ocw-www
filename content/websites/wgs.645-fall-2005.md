course_description: 'This subject investigates the special relation of women to several
  musical folk traditions in the British Isles and North America. Throughout, we will
  be examining the implications of gender in the creation, transmission, and performance
  of music. Because virtually all societies operate to some extent on a gendered division
  of labor (and of expressive roles) the music of these societies is marked by the
  gendering of musical repertoires, traditions of instrumentation, performance settings,
  and styles. This seminar will examine the gendered dimensions of the music - the
  song texts, the performance styles, processes of dissemination (collection, literary
  representation) and issues of historiography - with respect to selected traditions
  within the folk musics of North America and the British Isles, with the aim of analyzing
  the special contributions of women to these traditions. In addition to telling stories
  about women''s musical lives, and studying elements of female identity and subjectivity
  in song texts and music, we will investigate the ways in which women''s work and
  women''s cultural roles have affected the folk traditions of these several countries.
