course_description: 'This course studies what is language and what does knowledge
  of a language consist of. It asks how do children learn languages and is language
  unique to humans; why are there many languages; how do languages change; is any
  language or dialect superior to another; and how are speech and writing related.
  Context for these and similar questions is provided by basic examination of internal
  organization of sentences, words, and sound systems. No prior training in linguistics
  is assumed.
