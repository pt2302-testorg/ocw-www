course_description: 'This course explores photography as a disciplined way of seeing,
  of investigating landscapes and expressing ideas. Readings, observations, and photographs
  form the basis of discussions on landscape, light, significant detail, place, poetics,
  narrative, and how photography can inform design and planning, among other issues.
