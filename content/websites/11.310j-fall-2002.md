course_description: 'This workshop explores the potential of media technology and
  the Internet to enhance communication and transform city design and community development
  in inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods for describing
  or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions and changes, for
  presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple actors in the process
  of envisioning change and guiding action. Students will engage one neighborhood,
  meet real people working on real projects, put theory into practice, and reflect
  on insights gained in the process.


  This year the course will examine what it means to be an urban designer/planner
  and how to create a digital teaching tool (using digital storytelling) that supports
  others in learning about the relationship between design and planning professionals,
  on the one hand, and members of the communities they serve, on the other. What is
  the nature of the knowledge that resides in a community and how can designers and
  planners learn about, tap, and use that knowledge? What is the relationship between
  community organizing and urban design and planning? What are the relationships between
  you as a professional, the place(s) in which you work, and the values and care you
  bring to that work?


  We will explore these themes in the context of Camfield Estates in Lower Roxbury,
  MA and its participation in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development''s
  (HUD) Demonstration Disposition Project. There have been many stories written about
  Camfield Estates'' participation in the Demonstration Disposition project, for it
  has been widely regarded as a model of success. There are two stories that have
  not yet been told, however: the story of the residents who organized the community
  and the story of the architects and planners who participated in the project. This
  course will use digital storytelling to reconstruct and connect these two stories.
