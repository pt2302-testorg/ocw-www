course_description: "Revitalizing Urban Main Streets focuses on the physical and economic\
  \ renewal of urban neighborhood Main Streets by combining classroom work with an\
  \ applied class project. The course content covers three broad areas:\n\n1.  an\
  \ overview of the causes for urban business district decline, the challenges faced\
  \ in revitalization and the type of revitalization strategies employed;\n2.  the\
  \ physical and economic development planning tools used to understand and assess\
  \ urban Main Streets from physical design and economic development perspectives;\
  \ and\n3.  the policies, interventions, and investments used to foster urban commercial\
  \ revitalization.  \n    \n\nThe course has dual goals: to explore the integration\
  \ of economic and physical development interventions in ways that reinforce commercial\
  \ district revitalization efforts, and to apply this knowledge through the development\
  \ of a formal neighborhood commercial revitalization plan for a client business\
  \ district.\n"
