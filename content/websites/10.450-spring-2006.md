  tasks of process operations and control. Subject covers modeling the static and
  dynamic behavior of processes; control strategies; design of feedback, feedforward,
  and other control structures; and applications to process equipment.


  ### Dedication


  In preparing this material, the author has recalled with pleasure his own introduction,
  many years ago, to Process Control. This OCW course is dedicated with gratitude,
  to Prof. W. C. Clements of the University of Alabama.
