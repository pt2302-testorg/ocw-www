course_description: 'This course offers an introduction to the history and historiography
  of science from ancient Greece to the present. It is designed to serve as an introduction
  for those who have no prior background in the field and to deepen the knowledge
  of those who already do. We will consider how the history of science has responded
  to its encounters with philosophy, sociology, economics, and anthropology. Our readings
  and discussions will focus on determining what makes particular works effective,
  understanding major contemporary trends and debates in the history of science, and
  establishing resources for further research.
