course_description: 'This course introduces the ethnographic study of politics, i.e.,
  what anthropologists understand to be "political" in various social and economic
  systems, from small-scale societies to liberal democratic states. It examines politics
  across three contemporary contexts: electoral politics, public spheres, bureaucracies
  and humanitarian governance. Students consider and analyze how questions of authority,
  coercion, and violence have been theorized to relate to the political, and how some
  aspects of social life are regimented in explicitly non-political ways.
