course_description: 'The histories of information, communication, and computing technologies
  have attracted attention from scholars across a variety of disciplines. This course
  introduces students to prominent voices in these topics across fields. Alongside
  readings introducing students to this broad scholarly terrain, the course offers
  guidance in research and writing for publication based on the reality that PhD candidates
  on the job market need to be published authors, and that every term paper has the
  potential to be a journal article. We work towards publication by reading widely-cited
  scholarly histories both for their content and for what they can tell us about scholarly
  craft.
