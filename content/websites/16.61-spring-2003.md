course_description: 'This undergraduate course builds upon the dynamics content of
  Unified Engineering, a sophomore course taught in the Department of Aeronautics
  and Astronautics at MIT. Vector kinematics are applied to translation and rotation
  of rigid bodies. Newtonian and Lagrangian methods are used to formulate and solve
  equations of motion. Additional numerical methods are presented for solving rigid
  body dynamics problems. Examples and problems describe applications to aircraft
  flight dynamics and spacecraft attitude dynamics.
