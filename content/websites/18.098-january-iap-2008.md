course_description: 'This course teaches the art of guessing results and solving problems
  without doing a proof or an exact calculation. Techniques include extreme-cases
  reasoning, dimensional analysis, successive approximation, discretization, generalization,
  and pictorial analysis. Applications include mental calculation, solid geometry,
  musical intervals, logarithms, integration, infinite series, solitaire, and differential
  equations. **(No epsilons or deltas are harmed by taking this course.)** This course
  is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week
  term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.
