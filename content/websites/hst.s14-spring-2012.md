course_description: 'This course is a collaborative offering of [Sana](http://sana.mit.edu/),
  [Partners in Health](http://www.pih.org/), and the [Institute for Healthcare Improvement](http://www.ihi.org/Pages/default.aspx)
  (IHI). The goal of this course is the development of innovations in information
  systems for developing countries that will (1) translate into improvement in health
  outcomes, (2) strengthen the existing organizational infrastructure, and (3) create
  a collaborative ecosystem to maximize the value of these innovations. The course
  will be taught by guest speakers who are internationally recognized experts in the
  field and who, with their operational experiences, will outline the challenges they
  faced and detail how these were addressed.


  This OCW site combines resources from the initial Spring 2011 offering of the course
  (numbered HST.184) and the Spring 2012 offering (numbered HST.S14).
