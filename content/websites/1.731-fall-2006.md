course_description: "This subject is concerned with quantitative methods for analyzing\
  \ large-scale water resource problems. Topics covered include the design and management\
  \ of facilities for river basin development, flood control, water supply, groundwater\
  \ remediation, and other activities related to water resources. Simulation models\
  \ and optimization methods are often used to support analyses of water resource\
  \ problems. In this subject we will be constructing simulation models with the MATLAB\xAE\
  \ programming language and solving numerical optimization problems with the GAMS\
  \ optimization package.\n"
