course_description: 'The course covers the basic models and solution techniques for
  problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty (stochastic control). We
  will consider optimal control of a dynamical system over both a finite and an infinite
  number of stages. This includes systems with finite or infinite state spaces, as
  well as perfectly or imperfectly observed systems. We will also discuss approximation
  methods for problems involving large state spaces. Applications of dynamic programming
  in a variety of fields will be covered in recitations.
