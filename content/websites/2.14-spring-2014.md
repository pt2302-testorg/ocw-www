course_description: 'This course develops the fundamentals of feedback control using
  linear transfer function system models. Topics covered include analysis in time
  and frequency domains; design in the s-plane (root locus) and in the frequency domain
  (loop shaping); describing functions for stability of certain non-linear systems;
  extension to state variable systems and multivariable control with observers; discrete
  and digital hybrid systems and use of z-plane design. Students will complete an
  extended design case study. Students taking the graduate version (2.140) will attend
  the recitation sessions and complete additional assignments.
