course_description: 'This course is a comprehensive introduction to control system
  synthesis in which the digital computer plays a major role, reinforced with hands-on
  laboratory experience. The course covers elements of real-time computer architecture;
  input-output interfaces and data converters; analysis and synthesis of sampled-data
  control systems using classical and modern (state-space) methods; analysis of trade-offs
  in control algorithms for computation speed and quantization effects. Laboratory
  projects emphasize practical digital servo interfacing and implementation problems
  with timing, noise, and nonlinear devices.
