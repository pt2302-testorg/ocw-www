  of time structures narratives in a range of media. From Rembrandt''s lifetime of
  self-portraits to The Wire, Charles Dickens'' Pickwick Papers to contemporary journalism
  and reportage, we will focus on the relationships between popular culture and art,
  the problems of evaluation and audience, and the ways these works function within
  their social context.
