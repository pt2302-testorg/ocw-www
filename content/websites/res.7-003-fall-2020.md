  \ Human Genome Project and for eight years served as a science advisor to the White\
  \ House for President Obama. He\u2019s also the host of _Brave New Planet_, and\
  \ he\u2019s talked to leading researchers, journalists, doctors, policy makers,\
  \ activists, and legal experts to illuminate how this generation\u2019s choices\
