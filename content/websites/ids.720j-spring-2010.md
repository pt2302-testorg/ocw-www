course_description: "This course is an introduction to the analytical tools that support\
  \ design and decision-making in real estate and infrastructure development. There\
  \ is a particular focus on identifying and valuing sources of flexibility using\
  \ \u201Creal options\u201D, Monte-Carlo simulation, and other techniques from the\
  \ field of engineering systems. This course integrates economic and engineering\
  \ perspectives, and is suitable for students with various backgrounds. It serves\
  \ to provide useful preparation for thesis work in the area. The course applies\
  \ the approach to the design and phasing of a mega infrastructure real estate project.\n\
  \n**Note**\n\nThis MIT OpenCourseWare site is based, in part, on materials on Design\
  \ for Real Estate and Infrastructure Development from [Professor de Neufville's\
  \ and Professor Geltner's Web site](https://ardent.mit.edu/).\n"
