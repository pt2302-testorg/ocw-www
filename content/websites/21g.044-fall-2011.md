course_description: "This course is an introduction to three of the major genres of\
  \ traditional Chinese literature\u2014poetry, fiction and drama, with a focus on\
  \ vernacular fiction. We will read translations of a number of the \"masterworks\"\
  \ of Chinese literature. We will also examine the intertextuality between these\
  \ genres \u2014 how poetry blends into narrative, how fiction becomes drama, and\
  \ drama inspires fiction. Through reading these selected works of traditional Chinese\
  \ literature, we will examine some of the major features of traditional Chinese\
  \ society: religious and philosophical beliefs, the imperial system and dynastic\
  \ change, gender relations, notions of class and ethnicity, family, romance and\
  \ sexuality. All works are read in translation; no language background is necessary.\n"
