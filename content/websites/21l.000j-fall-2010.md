course_description: 'Students, scholars, bloggers, reviewers, fans, and book-group
  members write about literature, but so do authors themselves. Through the ways they
  engage with their own texts and those of other artists, sampling, remixing, and
  rethinking texts and genres, writers reflect on and inspire questions about the
  creative process. We will examine Mary Shelley''s reshaping of Milton''s _Paradise
  Lost_, German fairy tales, tales of scientific discovery, and her husband''s poems
  to make _Frankenstein_ (1818, 1831); Melville''s redesign of a travel narrative
  into a Gothic novella in _Benito Cereno_ (1856); and Alison Bechdel''s rewriting
  of Oscar Wilde''s _The Importance of Being Earnest_ (1895) in her graphic novel
  _Fun Home_ (2006). Showings of film versions of some of these works will allow us
  to project forward in the remixing process as well.
