course_description: 'Category theory is a relatively new branch of mathematics that
  has transformed much of pure math research. The technical advance is that category
  theory provides a framework in which to organize formal systems and by which to
  translate between them, allowing one to transfer knowledge from one field to another.
  But this same organizational framework also has many compelling examples outside
  of pure math. In this course, we will give seven sketches on real-world applications
  of category theory.
