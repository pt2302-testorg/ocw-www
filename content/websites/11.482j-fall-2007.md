course_description: 'The seminar is designed to provide advanced graduate students
  with a thorough understanding of selected regional economic theories and techniques
  and with experience in using alternative socioeconomic impact assessment models
  and related regional techniques on microcomputers. Discussions will be held on particular
  theoretical modeling and economic issues; linkages among theories, accounts, and
  policies; relationships between national and regional economic structures; and methods
  of adjusting and estimating regional input-output accounts and tables. Examples
  from the Boston area and other U.S. cities/regions will be used to illustrate points
  throughout the seminar. We will also examine how such models are used in other countries.
  New material on analyzing regional development issues will be covered.
