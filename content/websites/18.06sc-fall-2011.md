course_description: "This course covers matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing\
  \ topics useful in other disciplines such as physics, economics and social sciences,\
  \ natural sciences, and engineering. It parallels the combination of theory and\
  \ applications in Professor Strang\u2019s textbook [_Introduction to Linear Algebra_](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/).\n\
  \nCourse Format\n\nThis course has been designed for independent study. It provides\
  \ everything you will need to understand the concepts covered in the course. The\
  \ materials include:\n\n- A complete set of **Lecture Videos** by Professor Gilbert\
  \ Strang.\n- **Summary Notes** for all videos along with suggested readings in Prof.\
  \ Strang's textbook [_Linear Algebra_](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/).\n\
  - **Problem Solving Videos** on every topic taught by an experienced MIT Recitation\
  \ Instructor.\n- **Problem Sets** to do on your own with **Solutions** to check\
  \ your answers against when you're done.\n- A selection of **Java\xAE Demonstrations**\
  \ to illustrate key concepts.\n- A full set of **Exams with Solutions**, including\
  \ review material to help you prepare."
