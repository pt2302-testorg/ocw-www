course_description: 'This course discusses phase transitions in Earth''s interior.
  Phase transitions in Earth materials at high pressures and temperatures cause the
  seismic discontinuities and affect the convections in the Earth''s interior. On
  the other hand, they enable us to constrain temperature and chemical compositions
  in the Earth''s interior. However, among many known phase transitions in mineral
  physics, only a few have been investigated in seismology and geodynamics. This course
  reviews important papers about phase transitions in mantle and core materials.
