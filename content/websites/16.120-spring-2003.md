course_description: 'The course begins with the basics of compressible fluid dynamics,
  including governing equations, thermodynamic context and characteristic parameters.
  The next large block of lectures covers quasi-one-dimensional flow, followed by
  a discussion of disturbances and unsteady flows. The second half of the course comprises
  gas dynamic discontinuities, including shock waves and detonations, and concludes
  with another large block dealing with two-dimensional flows, both linear and non-linear.
