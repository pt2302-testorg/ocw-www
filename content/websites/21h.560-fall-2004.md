course_description: 'This subject examines the experiences of ordinary Chinese people
  as they lived through the tumultuous changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
  We look at personal narratives, primary sources, films alongside a textbook to think
  about how individual and family lives connect with the broader processes of change
  in modern China. In the readings and discussions, you should focus on how major
  political events have an impact on the characters'' daily lives, and how the decisions
  they make cause large-scale social transformation.
