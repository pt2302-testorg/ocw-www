course_description: 'Provides a comprehensive introduction to key issues and findings
  in object recognition in experimental, neural, computational, and applied domains.
  Emphasizes the problem of representation, exploring the issue of how 3-D objects
  should be encoded so as to efficiently recognize them from 2-D images. Second half
  focuses on face recognition, an ecologically important instance of the general object
  recognition problem. Describes experimental studies of human face recognition performance
  and recent attempts to mimic this ability in artificial computational systems.
