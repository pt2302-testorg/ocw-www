course_description: '6.012 is the header course for the department''s "Devices, Circuits
  and Systems" concentration. The topics covered include: modeling of microelectronic
  devices, basic microelectronic circuit analysis and design, physical electronics
  of semiconductor junction and MOS devices, relation of electrical behavior to internal
  physical processes, development of circuit models, and understanding the uses and
  limitations of various models. The course uses incremental and large-signal techniques
  to analyze and design bipolar and field effect transistor circuits, with examples
  chosen from digital circuits, single-ended and differential linear amplifiers, and
  other integrated circuits. This course is 12 units and is worth 4 Engineering Design
  Points.
