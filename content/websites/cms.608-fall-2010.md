course_description: "This course provides practical instruction in the design and\
  \ analysis of non-digital games. Students cover the texts, tools, references and\
  \ historical context to analyze and compare game designs across a variety of genres,\
  \ including sports, game shows, games of chance, card games, schoolyard games, board\
  \ games, and role\u2013playing games. In teams, students design, develop, and thoroughly\
  \ test their original games to understand the interaction and evolution of game\
  \ rules. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.\n"
