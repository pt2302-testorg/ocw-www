course_description: 'This class provides a space for medical students and MD/PhD students,
  as well as HASTS (History, Anthropology, Science, Technology, and Society) PhD students
  to discuss social and ethical issues in the biosciences and biotechnologies as they
  are being developed. Discussions are with course faculty and with leading figures
  in developing technologies such as George Daley or George Church in stem cell or
  genomics research, Bruce Walker or Pardis Sabeti in setting up laboratories in Africa,
  Paul Farmer and Partners in Health colleagues in building local support systems
  and first world quality care in Haiti, Peru, and Rwanda, and Amy Farber in building
  patient-centered therapeutic-outcome research for critical but "orphan" diseases.
  Goals include stimulating students to think about applying their learning in Boston
  to countries around the world, including using the experiences they have had in
  their home countries or research experience abroad. Goals also include a mix of
  patient-doctor care perspectives from medical anthropology, and moving upstream
  in the research chain to questions of how to move discoveries from basic research
  through the pipelines into clinical and bedside care.
