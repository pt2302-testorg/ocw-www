course_description: 'This practicum focuses on applying the principles of sustainability
  to improve the quality of life and activity along the Foshan downtown riverfront.
  The City has recently engaged in several planning efforts that, with the help of
  consultants and experts, will help to identify strategies to revitalize the City''s
  center and establish a new downtown. This practicum will compliment these efforts
  by focusing on planning and design options in and around the Pearl River, a now
  underutilized waterway that runs through the City''s new downtown.
