course_description: 'This course provides a deep understanding of engineering systems
  at a level intended for research on complex engineering systems. It provides a review
  and extension of what is known about system architecture and complexity from a theoretical
  point of view while examining the origins of and recent developments in the field.
  The class considers how and where the theory has been applied, and uses key analytical
  methods proposed. Students examine the level of observational (qualitative and quantitative)
  understanding necessary for successful use of the theoretical framework for a specific
  engineering system. Case studies apply the theory and principles to engineering
  systems.
