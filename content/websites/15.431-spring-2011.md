course_description: '_15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance_ examines the elements of entrepreneurial
  finance, focusing on technology-based start-up ventures and the early stages of
  company development. The course addresses key questions which challenge all entrepreneurs:
  how much money can and should be raised; when should it be raised and from whom;
  what is a reasonable valuation of the company; and how should funding, employment
  contracts and exit decisions be structured. It aims to prepare students for these
  decisions, both as entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In addition, the course
  includes an in-depth analysis of the structure of the private equity industry.
