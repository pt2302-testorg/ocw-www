course_description: 'This course provides students with an opportunity to conceive,
  design and implement a product, using rapid prototyping methods and computer-aid
  tools. The first of two phases challenges each student team to meet a set of design
  requirements and constraints for a structural component. A course of iteration,
  fabrication, and validation completes this manual design cycle. During the second
  phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis software,
  with their phase one prototype as a baseline.
