course_description: 'This course discusses applications of electromagnetic and equivalent
  quantum mechanical principles to classical and modern devices. It covers energy
  conversion and power flow in both macroscopic and quantum-scale electrical and electromechanical
  systems, including electric motors and generators, electric circuit elements, quantum
  tunneling structures and instruments. It studies photons as waves and particles
  and their interaction with matter in optoelectronic devices, including solar cells,
  displays, and lasers.


  The instructors would like to thank Scott Bradley, David Friend, Ta-Ming Shih, and
  Yasuhiro Shirasaki for helping to develop the course, and Kyle Hounsell, Ethan Koether,
  and Dmitri Megretski for their work preparing the lecture notes for OCW publication.
