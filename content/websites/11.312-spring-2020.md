course_description: 'This course proposes that most cities have neither the infrastructure
  nor the processes in place to support the demographically complex public in fulfilling
  its role in democracy. Through this course, participants will learn a set of design
  principles for creating public engagement practices necessary for building inclusive
  civic infrastructure in cities. Participants will also have the opportunity to review
  and practice strategies, techniques, and methods for engaging communities in demographically
  complex settings.
