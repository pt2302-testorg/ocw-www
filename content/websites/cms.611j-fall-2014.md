course_description: 'CMS.611J / 6.073 Creating Video Games is a class that introduces
  students to the complexities of working in small, multidisciplinary teams to develop
  video games. Students will learn creative design and production methods, working
  together in small teams to design, develop, and thoroughly test their own original
  digital games. Design iteration across all aspects of video game development (game
  design, audio design, visual aesthetics, fiction and programming) will be stressed.
  Students will also be required to focus test their games, and will need to support
  and challenge their game design decisions with appropriate focus testing and data
  analysis.
