course_description: 'This course takes a ''back to the beginning'' view that aims
  to better understand the end result. What might be the developmental processes that
  lead to the organization of ''booming, buzzing confusions'' into coherent visual
  objects? This course examines key experimental results and computational proposals
  pertinent to the discovery of objects in complex visual inputs. The structure of
  the course is designed to get students to learn and to focus on the genre of study
  as a whole; to get a feel for how science is done in this field.
