course_description: 'Our objective in this course is to introduce you to concepts
  and techniques related to the design, planning, control, and improvement of manufacturing
  and service operations. The course begins with a holistic view of operations, where
  we stress the coordination of product development, process management, and supply
  chain management. As the course progresses, we will investigate various aspects
  of each of these three tiers of operations in detail. We will cover topics in the
  areas of process analysis, materials management, production scheduling, quality
  improvement, and product design.


  To pursue the course objective most effectively, you will have to:


  1.  Study the assigned reading materials.

  2.  Prepare and discuss cases, readings, and exercises in class.

  3.  Prepare written analyses of cases.
