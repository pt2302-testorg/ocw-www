course_description: 'This class examines how and why twentieth-century Americans came
  to define the "good life" through consumption, leisure, and material abundance.
  We will explore how such things as department stores, nationally advertised brand-name
  goods, mass-produced cars, and suburbs transformed the American economy, society,
  and politics. The course is organized both thematically and chronologically. Each
  period deals with a new development in the history of consumer culture. Throughout
  we explore both celebrations and critiques of mass consumption and abundance.
