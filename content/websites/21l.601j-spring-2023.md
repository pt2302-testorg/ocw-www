course_description: "This course is an intensive introduction to Old English (also\
  \ called Anglo-Saxon), the ancestor of modern English that was spoken in England\
  \ *ca.* 600\u20131100. In the first half of the term, students use short prose texts\
  \ to study the basics of Old English grammar. They go on to read short poems, and\
  \ conclude by tackling portions of the epic Beowulf in the last third of the term.\
  \ Assessment is based upon translation work, daily vocabulary quizzes, and three\
  \ exams."
