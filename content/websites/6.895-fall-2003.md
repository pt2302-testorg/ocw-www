course_description: "6.895\_covers theoretical foundations of general-purpose parallel\
  \ computing systems, from languages to architecture. The focus is on the algorithmic\
  \ underpinnings of parallel systems. The topics for the class will vary depending\
  \ on student interest, but will likely include multithreading, synchronization,\
  \ race detection, load balancing, memory consistency, routing networks, message-routing\
  \ algorithms, and VLSI layout theory. The class will emphasize randomized algorithms\
  \ and probabilistic analysis, including high-probability arguments.\n\nThis course\
  \ was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)\
  \ (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5509 (Theory of Parallel Systems).\n"
