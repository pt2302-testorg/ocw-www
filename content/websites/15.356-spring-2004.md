course_description: 'To prosper, firms must develop major product and service innovations.
  Often, though, they don''t know how. Recent research into the innovation process
  has made it possible to develop "breakthroughs" systematically. 15.356 presents
  several practical concept development methods, such as the "Lead User Method," where
  manufacturers learn from innovative customers. Expert guest speakers present case
  studies that show the "art" required to implement a concept development method.
  15.356 is a half-term subject.
