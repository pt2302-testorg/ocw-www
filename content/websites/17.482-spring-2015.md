course_description: 'The purpose of this course is to acquaint the student with the
  missions, capabilities, and costs of the largely non-nuclear forces that make up
  the bulk of the U.S. military establishment. The course will also introduce the
  student to basic techniques for the assessment of relative military capabilities
  between adversaries in given theaters of military action. Central to the course
  will be an examination of historical cases of military action that shed light on
  current defence issues. Many of these cases are recent.
