course_description: "This course is a study of Behavior of Algorithms and covers an\
  \ area of current interest in theoretical computer science. The topics vary from\
  \ term to term. During this term, we discuss rigorous approaches to explaining the\
  \ typical performance of algorithms with a focus on the following approaches:\_\
  smoothed analysis, condition numbers/parametric analysis, and subclassing inputs.\n"
