course_description: 'This course introduces the principal algorithms for linear, network,
  discrete, nonlinear, dynamic optimization and optimal control. Emphasis is on methodology
  and the underlying mathematical structures. Topics include the simplex method, network
  flow methods, branch and bound and cutting plane methods for discrete optimization,
  optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization, interior point methods for convex
  optimization, Newton''s method, heuristic methods, and dynamic programming and optimal
  control methods.
