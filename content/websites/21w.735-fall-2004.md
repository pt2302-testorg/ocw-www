course_description: 'As the course title suggests, this class is meant to acquaint
  you with the literary and rhetorical tradition of the essay, a genre which has been
  described by one scholar as "the meeting ground between art and philosophy," and
  by another as "the place where the self finds a pattern in the world, and the world
  finds a pattern in the self". Though the essay is part of a tradition of prose which
  stretches back to antiquity, it is also a thoroughly modern and popular form of
  writing, found in print media and on the web.
