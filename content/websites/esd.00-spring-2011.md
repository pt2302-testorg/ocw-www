course_description: 'Students in ESD.00 work on projects to address large, complex
  and seemingly intractable real-world problems, such as energy supply, environmental
  issues, health care delivery, and critical infrastructure (e.g., telecommunications,
  water supply, and transportation). The course introduces interdisciplinary approaches
  - rooted in engineering, management, and the social sciences - to considering these
  critical contemporary issues. Small, faculty-led teams select an engineering systems
  term project to illustrate one or more of these approaches.
