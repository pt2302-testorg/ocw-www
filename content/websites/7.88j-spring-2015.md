course_description: 'This course covers amino acid sequence control of protein folding,
  misfolding, amyloid polymerization and aggregation. Readings and discussions address
  topics such as chaperone structure and function, folding and assembly of fibrous
  proteins, and pathologies associated with protein misfolding and aggregation in
  Alzheimer''s, Parkinson''s, Huntington''s and other protein deposition diseases.
  Students are required to write and present a research paper.
