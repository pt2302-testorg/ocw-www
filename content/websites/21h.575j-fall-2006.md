course_description: 'This course is designed to introduce and help students understand
  the changes and continuities in the lives of women in South Asia from a historical
  perspective. Using gender as a lens of examining the past, we will examine how politics
  of race, class, caste and religion affected and continue to impact women in South
  Asian countries, primarily in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. We will
  reflect upon current debates within South Asian women''s history in order to examine
  some of the issues and problems that arise in re-writing the past from a gendered
  perspective and these are found in primary documents, secondary readings, films,
  newspaper articles, and the Internet.
