course_description: 'This course addresses the challenges of defining a relationship
  between exposure to environmental chemicals and human disease. Course topics include
  epidemiological approaches to understanding disease causation; biostatistical methods;
  evaluation of human exposure to chemicals, and their internal distribution, metabolism,
  reactions with cellular components, and biological effects; and qualitative and
  quantitative health risk assessment methods used in the U.S. as bases for regulatory
  decision-making. Throughout the term, students consider case studies of local and
  national interest.
