course_description: "This course is the first part of a modular sequence of increasingly\
  \ sophisticated (and challenging) laboratory courses required of all Chemistry majors:\
  \ 5.35 Introduction to Experimental Chemistry, 5.36\_Biochemistry and Organic Laboratory,\
  \ 5.37\_Organic and Inorganic Laboratory, and 5.38\_Physical Chemistry Laboratory.\
  \ This course provides students with a survey of spectroscopy, and introduces synthesis\
  \ of coordination compounds and kinetics.\n\nThis class is part of the new laboratory\
  \ curriculum in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Undergraduate Research-Inspired\
  \ Experimental Chemistry Alternatives ([URIECA](http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/www/academic/urieca.html))\
  \ introduces students to cutting edge research topics in a modular format.\n\n#####\
  \ Acknowledgements\n\nProfessor Nelson and Dr. Twardowski would like to acknowledge\
  \ the contributions of MIT Professor Timothy Swager to the development of this course.\
  \ Module 3 on Fabrication of a Polymeric Light Emitting Device, taught by Timothy\
  \ Swager, is not currently available on OCW.\n"
