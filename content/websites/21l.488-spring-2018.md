course_description: 'In this class we will focus on the connections between urban
  exploration and reading, attending to such shared concerns as pacing, legibility,
  transgression, attention and distraction, tracing and retracing, and memory. This
  idea of re-reading cities will be both a theme centering our discussions and a guiding
  principle of the course design, as we continuously loop back, returning to haunt
  texts we left behind earlier in the semester.
