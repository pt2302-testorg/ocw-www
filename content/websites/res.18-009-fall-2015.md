course_description: "_Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with_ __Gilbert Strang_\
  \ and_ _Cleve Moler_ is an in-depth series of videos about differential equations\
  \ and the MATLAB{{< sup \"\xAE\" >}} ODE suite. These videos are suitable for students\
  \ and life-long learners to enjoy.\n\nAbout the Instructors\n---------------------\n\
  \nGilbert Strang is the MathWorks Professor of Mathematics at MIT. His research\
  \ focuses on mathematical analysis, linear algebra and PDEs. He has written textbooks\
  \ on linear algebra, computational science, finite elements, wavelets, GPS, and\
  \ calculus.\n\nCleve Moler is chief mathematician, chairman, and cofounder of MathWorks.\
  \ He was a professor of math and computer science for almost 20 years at the University\
  \ of Michigan, Stanford University, and the University of New Mexico.\n\nThese videos\
  \ were produced by [The MathWorks{{< sup \"\xAE\" >}}](http://in.mathworks.com/)\
  \ and are also available on [The MathWorks website](http://in.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/learn-differential-equations.html).\n"
