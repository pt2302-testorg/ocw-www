course_description: This course examines the distinctive ways in which historians
  in different parts of the world have approached the task of writing history. It
  explores methodologies used, such as political, social, economic, cultural, and
  popular histories through the reading and discussion of relevant and innovative
  texts. It introduces a variety of sources (archival documents, statistical data,
  film, fiction, memoirs, artifacts, and images) and the ways they can be used to
  research, interpret, and present the past. Assignments include an original research
  paper. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.
