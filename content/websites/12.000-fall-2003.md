course_description: "Solving Complex Problems provides an opportunity for entering\
  \ freshmen to gain first-hand experience with working as part of a team to develop\
  \ effective approaches to complex problems in Earth system science and engineering\
  \ that do not have straightforward solutions. The subject includes training in a\
  \ variety of skills, ranging from library research to [Web Design](/courses/12-000-solving-complex-problems-fall-2003/pages/tools).\n\
  \nEach year's course explores a different problem in detail through the study of\
  \ complimentary case histories and the development of\_[creative solution strategies](/courses/12-000-solving-complex-problems-fall-2003/pages/projects/_index).\
  \ Beginning in 2000 as an educational experiment sponsored by MIT's Committee on\
  \ the Undergraduate Program, and receiving major financial support from the\_[Alex\
  \ and Britt d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT Education](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/darb-0310.html),\
  \ the subject is designed to enhance the first-semester freshman experience by helping\
  \ students develop contexts for other subjects in the sciences and humanities, and\
  \ by helping them to establish learning communities that include upperclassmen,\
  \ faculty, MIT alumni, and professionals from many walks of life.\n\nIn Fall 2003,\
  \ students from the Class of 2007 were challenged with \u201CMission 2007\u201D\
  :\n\n*   To design the most \"environmentally correct\" strategy for oil exploration\
  \ and extraction in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and\n*   To perform\
  \ a cost-benefit analysis in order to evaluate whether or not the hydrocarbon resources\
  \ that might be extracted from beneath ANWR are worth the environmental damage that\
  \ might result from the process.\n"
