course_description: 'This course explores the political, social, and economic factors
  commonly offered to explain the fall of the Roman Republic: growth of the territorial
  empire, increased intensity of aristocratic competition, transformation of the Italian
  economy, growth of the city of Rome and dependence of the urban plebs, changes in
  military recruitment and dependence of soldiers on their generals. There is an emphasis
  on the reading of ancient sources in translation, including Cicero, Sallust, Caesar,
  Augustus, Appian, Plutarch, and Suetonius.
