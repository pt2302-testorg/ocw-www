course_description: "Sometime after 1492, the concept of the New World or America\
  \ came into being, and this concept appeared differently - as an experience or an\
  \ idea - for different people and in different places. This semester, we will read\
  \ three groups of texts: first, participant accounts of contact between native Americans\
  \ and French or English speaking Europeans, both in North America and in the Caribbean\
  \ and Brazil; second, transformations of these documents into literary works by\
  \ contemporaries; third, modern texts which take these earlier materials as a point\
  \ of departure for rethinking the experience and aftermath of contact. The reading\
  \ will allow us to compare perspectives across time and space, across the cultural\
  \ geographies of religion, nation and ethnicity, and finally across a range of genres\
  \ - reports, captivity narratives, essays, novels, poetry, drama, and film. Some\
  \ of the earlier authors we will read are Michel Montaigne, William Shakespeare,\
  \ Jean de L\xE9ry, Daniel Defoe and Mary Rowlandson; more recent authors include\
  \ Derek Walcott, and J. M. Coetzee.\n"
