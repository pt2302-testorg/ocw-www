course_description: "Today many people assume that technological change is the major\
  \ factor in historical change and that it tends to lead to historical progress.\
  \ This class turns these assumptions into a question\u2014what is the role of technology\
  \ in history?\u2014by focusing on four key historical transitions: the human revolution\
  \ (the emergence of humans as a history-making species), the Neolithic Revolution\
  \ (the emergence of agriculture-based civilizations); the great leap in productivity\
  \ (also known as the industrial revolution), and the great acceleration that has\
  \ come with the rise of human empire on the planet. These topics are studied through\
  \ a mix of textbook reading (David Christian's \"Maps of Time\"), supplementary\
  \ readings (ranging from Auel, \"The Clan of the Cave Bear\" to Hersey, \"Hiroshima\"\
  ), illustrated lectures, class discussions, guest lectures/discussions, short \"\
  problem paper\" assignments, and a final project defined by the student.\n\nBecause\
  \ MIT is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2011, this version of the class will\
  \ also focus on connections between MIT as an institution and technology in the\
  \ history of the last 150 years.\n"
