course_description: 'As markets or production bases, China and India are becoming
  important and integral players in the global economy. Foreign direct investment
  (FDI), portfolio investments and outsourcing businesses have increased dramatically
  in these two economies. Despite the rising importance of these two economies on
  the world stage, our knowledge and analysis of these two countries in an integrated
  manner has remained poor. The two are often lumped together by business analysts
  as "emerging markets," despite the substantial differences in their political systems,
  reform policies and business organizations. Academics, in contrast, have tended
  to treat the two countries separately, preferring to specialize in issues and questions
  specific to one or the other country.


  The purpose of this course is to analyze these two countries within a coherent analytical
  framework. Our learning model is inductive, and heavily based on class discussions
  and participation. The group projects should aim at integrating analysis, knowledge
  and understanding of these two countries. We will also experiment with other forms
  of group projects, such as creating and working on business plans and those projects
  that integrate research from field trips with more traditional research, such as
  library research. There is no prerequisite but 15.012 (Applied Macro- and International
  Economics) and 15.223 (Global Markets, National Policies and the Competitive Advantage
  of Firms) are highly recommended.
