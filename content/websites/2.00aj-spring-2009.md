course_description: 'Student teams formulate and complete space/earth/ocean exploration-based
  design projects with weekly milestones. This course introduces core engineering
  themes, principles, and modes of thinking, and includes exercises in written and
  oral communication and team building. Specialized learning modules enable teams
  to focus on the knowledge required to complete their projects, such as machine elements,
  electronics, design process, visualization and communication. Examples of projects
  include surveying a lake for millfoil from a remote controlled aircraft, then sending
  out robotic harvesters to clear the invasive growth; and exploration to search for
  the evidence of life on a moon of Jupiter, with scientists participating through
  teleoperation and supervisory control of robots.
