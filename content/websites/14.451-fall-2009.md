course_description: 'This course focuses on dynamic optimization methods, both in
  discrete and in continuous time. We approach these problems from a dynamic programming
  and optimal control perspective. We also study the dynamic systems that come from
  the solutions to these problems. The course will illustrate how these techniques
  are useful in various applications, drawing on many economic examples. However,
  the focus will remain on gaining a general command of the tools so that they can
  be applied later in other classes.
