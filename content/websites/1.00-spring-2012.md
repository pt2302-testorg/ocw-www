course_description: "This course presents the fundamentals of object-oriented software\
  \ design and development, computational methods and sensing for engineering, and\
  \ scientific and managerial applications. It cover topics, including design of classes,\
  \ inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors,\
  \ and data structures. Students use Java{{< sup \"\xAE\" >}} programming language\
  \ to complete weekly software assignments.\n\n**How is 1.00 different from other\
  \ intro programming courses offered at MIT?**\n\n1.00 is a first course in programming.\
  \ It assumes no prior experience, and it focuses on the use of computation to solve\
  \ problems in engineering, science and management. The audience for 1.00 is non-computer\
  \ science majors. 1.00 does not focus on writing compilers or parsers or computing\
  \ tools where the computer is the system; it focuses on engineering problems where\
  \ the computer is part of the system, or is used to model a physical or logical\
  \ system.\n\n1.00 teaches the Java programming language, and it focuses on the design\
  \ and development of object-oriented software for technical problems. 1.00 is taught\
  \ in an active learning style. Lecture segments alternating with laboratory exercises\
  \ are used in every class to allow students to put concepts into practice immediately;\
  \ this teaching style generates questions and feedback, and allows the teaching\
  \ staff and students to interact when concepts are first introduced to ensure that\
  \ core ideas are understood. Like many MIT classes, 1.00 has weekly assignments,\
  \ which are programs based on actual engineering, science or management applications.\
  \ The weekly assignments build on the class material from the previous week, and\
  \ require students to put the concepts taught in the small in-class labs into a\
  \ larger program that uses multiple elements of Java together.\n"
