course_description: "It is easy to think of love as a \"universal language\" - but\
  \ do ideas about love translate easily across history, culture, and identity? In\
  \ this course, we will encounter some surprising, even disturbing ideas about love\
  \ and sex from medieval writers and characters: For instance, that married people\
  \ can never be in love, that the most satisfying romantic love incorporates pain\
  \ and violence, and that intense erotic pleasure can be found in celibate service\
  \ to God. Through Arthurian romances, Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, love letters,\
  \ mystical visions, and more, we will explore medieval attitudes toward marriage,\
  \ sexuality, and gender roles. What can these perspectives teach us about the uniqueness\
  \ of the Middle Ages\u2014and how do medieval ideas about love continue to influence\
  \ the beliefs and fantasies of our own culture?\n"
