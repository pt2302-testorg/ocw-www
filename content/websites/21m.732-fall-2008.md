course_description: 'This is an intermediate workshop designed for students who have
  a basic understanding of the principles of theatrical design and who want a more
  intensive study of costume design and the psychology of clothing. Students develop
  designs that emerge through a process of character analysis, based on the script
  and directorial concept. Period research, design, and rendering skills are fostered
  through practical exercises. Instruction in basic costume construction, including
  drafting and draping, provide tools for students to produce final projects.
