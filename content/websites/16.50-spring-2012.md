course_description: 'This course presents aerospace propulsive devices as systems,
  with functional requirements and engineering and environmental limitations along
  with requirements and limitations that constrain design choices. Both air-breathing
  and rocket engines are covered, at a level which enables rational integration of
  the propulsive system into an overall vehicle design. Mission analysis, fundamental
  performance relations, and exemplary design solutions are presented.
