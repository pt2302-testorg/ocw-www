course_description: 'In this course, we will lay the foundation for understanding
  how materials behave in nuclear systems. In particular, we will build on a solid
  base of nuclear material fundamentals in order to understand radiation damage and
  effects in fuels and structural materials. This course consists of a series of directed
  readings, lectures on video, problem sets, short research projects, and class discussions
  with worked examples. We will start with an overview of nuclear materials, where
  they are found in nuclear systems, and how they fail. We will then develop the formalism
  in crystallography as a common language for materials scientists everywhere. This
  will be followed by the development of phase diagrams from thermodynamics, which
  predict how binary alloy systems evolve towards equilibrium. Then effects of stress,
  defects, and kinetics will be introduced. These will all be tied together when developing
  theories about how radiation, particularly neutrons and heavy charged particles,
  interact with solid matter to produce defects and evolve microstructure. A few applications
  of radiation effects will then be treated with this newfound framework, including
  the change of material properties under irradiation, void swelling, embrittlement,
  loss of ductility, and the simulation of in-reactor irradiation (neutrons) with
  heavy ions.
