course_description: 'This workshop is designed to introduce students to different
  perspectives on international politics in the 21st century. Students will explore
  how advances in information technology are changing international relations and
  global governance through opening new channels of communication, creating new methods
  of education, and new potentials for democratization. We will consider the positive
  and negative externalities associated with applications of such technologies. Students
  will be encouraged to look at alternative futures, and/or to frame solutions to
  problems that they define. The class will include guest lectures, discussions, and
  a final project and presentation.
