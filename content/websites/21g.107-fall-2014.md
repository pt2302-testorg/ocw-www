course_description: 'This course, along with [21G.108 / 158](/courses/21g-108-chinese-ii-streamlined-spring-2015/)
  offered in the spring, form the elementary level of the streamlined sequence, which
  is for students who have some basic conversational skills gained, typically, from
  growing up in a Chinese speaking environment, but lack a corresponding level of
  literacy. The focus of the course is on learning standard everyday usage, on reading
  in both full and simplified characters, and on writing. This course, along with
  [21G.108 / 158](/courses/21g-108-chinese-ii-streamlined-spring-2015/) offered in
  the spring, are conducted entirely in Chinese.
