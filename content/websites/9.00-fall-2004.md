course_description: 'This course surveys questions about human behavior and mental
  life ranging from how you see to why you fall in love. The great controversies:
  nature and nurture, free will, consciousness, human differences, self and society.
  Students are exposed to the range of theoretical perspectives including biological,
  evolutionary, cognitive, and psychoanalytic. One of the best aspects of Psychology
  is that you are the subject matter. This makes it possible to do many demonstrations
  in lecture that allow you to experience the topic under study. Lectures work in
  tandem with the textbook. The course breaks into small recitations sections to allow
  discussion, oral presentations, and individual contact with instructors.
