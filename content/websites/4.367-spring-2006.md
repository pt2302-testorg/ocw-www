course_description: 'How do we define Public Art? This course focuses on the production
  of projects for public places. Public Art is a concept that is in constant discussion
  and revision, as much as the evolution and transformation of public spaces and cities
  are. Monuments are repositories of memory and historical presences with the expectation
  of being permanent. Public interventions are created not to impose and be temporary,
  but as forms intended to activate discourse and discussion. Considering the concept
  of a museum as a public device and how they are searching for new ways of avoiding
  generic identities, we will deal with the concept of the personal imaginary museum.
  It should be considered as a point of departure to propose a personal individual
  construction based on the concept of defining a personal imaginary museum - concept,
  program, collection, events, architecture, public diffusion, etc.
