course_description: 'This course explores the relationships which exist between the
  performance of electrical, optical, and magnetic devices and the microstructural
  characteristics of the materials from which they are constructed. The class uses
  a device-motivated approach which emphasizes emerging technologies. Device applications
  of physical phenomena are considered, including electrical conductivity and doping,
  transistors, photodetectors and photovoltaics, luminescence, light emitting diodes,
  lasers, optical phenomena, photonics, ferromagnetism, and magnetoresistance.
