course_description: 'You can build a wide range of practical electronic devices if
  you understand a few basic electronics concepts and follow some simple rules. These
  devices include light-activated and sound-activated toys and appliances, remote
  controls, timers and clocks, and motorized devices.


  The subject begins with an overview of the fundamental concepts, followed by a series
  of laboratory exercises that demonstrate the basic rules, and a final project.
