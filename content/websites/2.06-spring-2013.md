course_description: 'This class provides students with an introduction to principal
  concepts and methods of fluid mechanics. Topics covered in the course include pressure,
  hydrostatics, and buoyancy; open systems and control volume analysis; mass conservation
  and momentum conservation for moving fluids; viscous fluid flows, flow through pipes;
  dimensional analysis; boundary layers, and lift and drag on objects. Students will
  work to formulate the models necessary to study, analyze, and design fluid systems
  through the application of these concepts, and to develop the problem-solving skills
  essential to good engineering practice of fluid mechanics in practical applications.
