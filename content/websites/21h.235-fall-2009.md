course_description: "> Hitherto it had gone by the original Indian name Manna-hatta,\
  \ or as some still have it, 'The Manhattoes'; but this was now decried as savage\
  \ and heathenish... At length, when the council was almost in despair, a burgher,\
  \ remarkable for the size and squareness of his head, proposed that they should\
  \ call it New-Amsterdam. The proposition took every body by surprise; it was so\
  \ striking, so apposite, so ingenious. The name was adopted by acclamation, and\
  \ New-Amsterdam the metropolis was thenceforth called.\n> \n> \u2014Washington Irving,\
  \ 1808\n\nIn less tongue-in-cheek style, this course examines the evolution of New\
  \ York City from 1607 to the present. The readings focus on the city's social and\
  \ physical histories, and the class discussions compare New York's development to\
  \ patterns in other cities.\n"
