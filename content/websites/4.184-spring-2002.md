course_description: 'An intensive nine day remote collaborative workshop involving
  MIT and Miyagi University in Japan. The objective is to develop a small housing
  project using shape computation as a design methodology. Students will use and test
  new interactive software for designing, sharing applications with overseas partners,
  presenting projects on an Internet workspace, and critiquing design proposals through
  the web and other advanced digital technologies. Students will be expected to do
  most of their work in class.
