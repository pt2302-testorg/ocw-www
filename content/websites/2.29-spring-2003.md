course_description: 'This course is an introduction to numerical methods: interpolation,
  differentiation, integration, and systems of linear equations. It covers the solution
  of differential equations by numerical integration, as well as partial differential
  equations of inviscid hydrodynamics: finite difference methods, boundary integral
  equation panel methods. Also addressed are introductory numerical lifting surface
  computations, fast Fourier transforms, the numerical representation of deterministic
  and random sea waves, as well as integral boundary layer equations and numerical
  solutions.


  This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering)
  as 13.024. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department
  of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.29.
