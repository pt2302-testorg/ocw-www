course_description: "Innovation in expression, as realized in media, tangible objects,\
  \ performance and more, \_generates new questions and new potentials for human engagement.\
  \ When and how does expression engage us deeply? Many personal stories confirm the\
  \ hypothesis that once we experience deep engagement, it is a state we long for,\
  \ remember, and want to repeat. This class will explore\_what\_underlying\_principles\
  \ and innovative methods can ensure the development of higher-quality \"deep engagement\"\
  \_products (artifacts, experiences, environments, performances, etc.) that appeal\
  \ to a broad audience and that have lasting value over the long term.\n"
