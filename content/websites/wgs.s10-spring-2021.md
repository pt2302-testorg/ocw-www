course_description: "Black feminist health science studies is a critical intervention\
  \ into a number of intersecting arenas of scholarship and activism, including feminist\
  \ health studies, contemporary medical curriculum reform conversations, and feminist\
  \ technoscience studies. We argue towards a theory of Black feminist health science\
  \ studies that builds on social justice science, which has as its focus the health\
  \ and well-being of marginalized groups. Students will engage feminist science theories\
  \ such as the linguistic metaphors of the immune system, the medicalization of race,\
  \ and critiques of the sexual binary. We will use contemporary as well as historical\
  \ moments to investigate the evolution of \u201Cscientific truth\u201D and its impact\
  \ on the U.S. cultural landscape.\n"
