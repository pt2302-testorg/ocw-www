course_description: 'The course includes survey and special topics designed for graduate
  students in the brain and cognitive sciences. It emphasizes ethological studies
  of natural behavior patterns and their analysis in laboratory work, with contributions
  from field biology (mammology, primatology), sociobiology, and comparative psychology.
  It stresses mammalian behavior but also includes major contributions from studies
  of other vertebrates and of invertebrates. It covers some applications of animal-behavior
  knowledge to neuropsychology and behavioral pharmacology.
