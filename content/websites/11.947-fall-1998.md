course_description: 'Kevin Lynch''s landmark volume, _The Image of the City_ (1960),
  emphasized the perceptual characteristics of the urban environment, stressing the
  ways that individuals mentally organize their own sensory experience of cities.
  Increasingly, however, city imaging is supplemented and constructed by exposure
  to visual media, rather than by direct sense experience of urban realms. City images
  are not static, but subject to constant revision and manipulation by a variety of
  media-savvy individuals and institutions. In recent years, urban designers (and
  others) have used the idea of city image proactively -- seeking innovative ways
  to alter perceptions of urban, suburban, and regional areas. City imaging, in this
  sense, is the process of constructing visually-based narratives about the potential
  of places.
