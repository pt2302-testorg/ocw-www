course_description: '1.201J/11.545J/ESD.210J is required for all first-year Master
  of Science in Transportation students. It would be of interest to, as well as accessible
  to, students in Urban Studies and Planning, Political Science, Technology and Policy,
  Management, and various engineering departments. It is a good subject for those
  who plan to take only one subject in transportation and serves as an entry point
  to other transportation subjects as well.


  The subject focuses on fundamental principles of transportation systems, introduces
  transportation systems components and networks, and addresses how one invests in
  and operates them effectively. The tie between transportation and related systems
  is emphasized.
