course_description: 'This course focuses on the archaeology of the Greek and Roman
  city. It investigates the relationship between urban architecture and the political,
  social, and economic role of cities in the Greek and Roman world, by analyzing a
  range of archaeological and literary evidence relevant to the use of space in Greek
  and Roman cities (e.g. Athens, Paestum, Rome, Pompeii) and a range of theoretical
  frameworks for the study of ancient urbanism.
