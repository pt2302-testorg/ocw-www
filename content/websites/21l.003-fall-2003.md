course_description: 'This course investigates the uses and boundaries of fiction in
  a range of novels and narrative styles--traditional and innovative, western and
  nonwestern--and raises questions about the pleasures and meanings of verbal texts
  in different cultures, times, and forms. Toward the end of the term, we will be
  particularly concerned with the relationship between art and war in a diverse selection
  of works.
