course_description: "These brief videos, recorded in 2020, contain ideas and suggestions\
  \ from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning\
  \ linear algebra. The first topic is called _A New Way to Start Linear Algebra_.\
  \ The key point is to start right in with the columns of a matrix _A_ and the multiplication\
  \ _Ax_ that combines those columns.\n\nThat leads to _The Column Space of a Matrix_\
  \ and the idea of independent columns and the factorization _A = CR_ that tells\
  \ so much about _A_. With good numbers, every student can see dependent columns.\n\
  \nThe remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: _The Big Picture of\
  \ Linear Algebra_; _Orthogonal Vectors_; _Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors_; and _Singular\
  \ Values & Singular Vectors_. Singular values have become so important and they\
  \ come directly from the eigenvalues of _A'A_.\n\nA new video recorded in 2021,\
  \ _Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination_, computes the nullspace\
  \ of any matrix _A_.\n\nYou can see this new idea developing in the [first video\

  \ Signal Processing, and Machine Learning](/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)_.\n"
