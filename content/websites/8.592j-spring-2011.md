course_description: 'Statistical Physics in Biology is a survey of problems at the
  interface of statistical physics and modern biology. Topics include: bioinformatic
  methods for extracting information content of DNA; gene finding, sequence comparison,
  and phylogenetic trees; physical interactions responsible for structure of biopolymers;
  DNA double helix, secondary structure of RNA, and elements of protein folding; considerations
  of force, motion, and packaging; protein motors, membranes. We also look at collective
  behavior of biological elements, cellular networks, neural networks, and evolution.
