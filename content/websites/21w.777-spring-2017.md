course_description: 'This class addresses the craft of writing about science in and
  for contemporary society, both its pleasures and its challenges. We will read essays,
  reportage, op-eds, and web-based articles on a variety of topics concerning science,
  technology, medicine and nature. Readings by contemporary writers such as Elizabeth
  Kolbert, Atul Gawande, and Michael Pollan will serve as examples of the craft and
  sources of ideas for our own writing.
