course_description: "This is a class about applying autonomy to real-world systems.\
  \ The overarching theme uniting the many different topics in this course will center\
  \ around programming a cognitive robotic. This class takes the approach of introducing\
  \ new reasoning techniques and ideas incrementally. We start with the current paradigm\
  \ of programming you're likely familiar with, and evolve it over the semester\u2014\
  continually adding in new features and reasoning capabilities\u2014ending with a\
  \ robust, intelligent system. These techniques and topics will include algorithms\
  \ for allowing a robot to: Monitor itself for potential problems (both observable\
  \ and hidden), scheduling tasks in time, coming up with novel plans to achieve desired\
  \ goals over time, dealing with the continuous world, collaborating with other (autonomous)\
  \ agents, dealing with risk, and more.\n"
