course_description: "Topics for this course are based primarily on reading and discussions\
  \ of original research literature that cover the analysis as well as the underlying\
  \ physical and physiological mechanisms of acoustic signals in the auditory periphery.\
  \ Topics include the acoustics, mechanics, and hydrodynamics of sound transmission;\
  \ the biophysical basis for cochlear amplification; the physiology of hair-cell\
  \ transduction and synaptic transmission; efferent feedback control; the analysis\
  \ and coding of simple and complex sounds by the inner ear; and the physiological\
  \ bases for\_hearing disorders.\n"
