course_description: 'This class will be constructed as a lecture-discussion, the purpose
  being to engage important theoretical issues while simultaneously studying their
  continuing historical significance. To enhance discussion, three debates will be
  held in class. Each student will be required to participate in one of these debates.
  Each student will also be required to write three short papers. Class participation
  is essential and will be factored into the final grade.


  The course will portray the history of theory neither as the history of architectural
  theory exclusively, nor as a series of prepackaged static pronouncements, but as
  part of a broader set of issues with an active history that must be continually
  probed and queried. The sequence of topics will not be absolutely predetermined,
  but some of the primary issues that will be addressed are: pedagogy, professionalism,
  nature, modernity and the Enlightenment. Classroom discussions and debates are intended
  to demonstrate differences of opinion and enhance awareness of the consequences
  that these differences had in specific historical contexts.
