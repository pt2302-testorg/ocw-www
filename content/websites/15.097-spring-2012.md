course_description: 'Prediction is at the heart of almost every scientific discipline,
  and the study of generalization (that is, prediction) from data is the central topic
  of machine learning and statistics, and more generally, data mining. Machine learning
  and statistical methods are used throughout the scientific world for their use in
  handling the "information overload" that characterizes our current digital age.
  Machine learning developed from the artificial intelligence community, mainly within
  the last 30 years, at the same time that statistics has made major advances due
  to the availability of modern computing. However, parts of these two fields aim
  at the same goal, that is, of prediction from data. This course provides a selection
  of the most important topics from both of these subjects.
