course_description: 'The numerical methods, formulation and parameterizations used
  in models of the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean will be described in detail.
  Widely used numerical methods will be the focus but we will also review emerging
  concepts and new methods. The numerics underlying a hierarchy of models will be
  discussed, ranging from simple GFD models to the high-end GCMs. In the context of
  ocean GCMs, we will describe parameterization of geostrophic eddies, mixing and
  the surface and bottom boundary layers. In the atmosphere, we will review parameterizations
  of convection and large scale condensation, the planetary boundary layer and radiative
  transfer.
