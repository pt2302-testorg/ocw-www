course_description: 'As a quasi-historical, quasi-legendary figure of consistently
  great popularity, King Arthur has been subject to an extraordinary amount of reinvention
  and rewriting: as a Christian hero and war-leader; as an ineffective king and pathetic
  cuckold; and as a tragic figure of noble but doomed intentions. As we trace Arthur''s
  evolution and that of principal knights, we will ask what underlies the appeal of
  this figure whose consistent reappearance in western culture has performed the medieval
  prophecy that he would be _rex quondam et futurus_: the once and future king.
