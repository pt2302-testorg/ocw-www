course_description: 'The electron microprobe provides a complete micrometer-scale
  quantitative chemical analysis of inorganic solids. The method is nondestructive
  and utilizes characteristic X-rays excited by an electron beam incident on a flat
  surface of the sample. This course provides an introduction to the theory of X-ray
  microanalysis through wavelength and energy dispersive spectrometry (WDS and EDS),
  ZAF matrix correction procedures and scanning electron imaging with back-scattered
  electron (BSE), secondary electron (SE), X-ray using WDS or EDS (elemental mapping),
  and cathodoluminescence (CL). Lab sessions involve hands-on use of the JEOL JXA-8200
  Superprobe.
