course_description: 'This course outlines the physics, modeling, application, and
  technology of compound semiconductors (primarily III-Vs) in electronic, optoelectronic,
  and photonic devices and integrated circuits. Topics include: properties, preparation,
  and processing of compound semiconductors; theory and practice of heterojunctions,
  quantum structures, and pseudomorphic strained layers; metal-semiconductor field
  effect transistors (MESFETs); heterojunction field effect transistors (HFETs) and
  bipolar transistors (HBTs); photodiodes, vertical-and in-plane-cavity laser diodes,
  and other optoelectronic devices.
