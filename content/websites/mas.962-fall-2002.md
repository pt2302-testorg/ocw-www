course_description: 'How do words get their meanings? How can word meanings be represented
  and used by machines? We will explore three families of approaches to these questions
  from a computational perspective. Relational / structural methods such as semantic
  networks represent the meaning of words in terms of their relations to other words.
  Knowledge of the world through perception and action leads to the notion of external
  grounding, a process by which word meanings are ''attached'' to the world. How an
  agent theorizes about, and conceptualizes its world provides yet another foundation
  for word meanings. We will examine each of these perspectives, and consider ways
  to integrate them.
