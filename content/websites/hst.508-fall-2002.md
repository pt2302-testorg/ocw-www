course_description: 'This course will assess the relationships among sequence, structure,
  and function in complex biological networks as well as progress in realistic modeling
  of quantitative, comprehensive, functional genomics analyses. Exercises will include
  algorithmic, statistical, database, and simulation approaches and practical applications
  to medicine, biotechnology, drug discovery, and genetic engineering. Future opportunities
  and current limitations will be critically addressed. In addition to the regular
  lecture sessions, supplementary sections are scheduled to address issues related
  to Perl, Mathematica and biology.
