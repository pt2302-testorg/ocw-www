course_description: 'This course is a survey of recent philosophy of perception. The
  main topics discussed are the following: the transparency of perceptual experience,
  disjunctivism, the content of perceptual experience, perceptual consciousness, thought
  ownership and thought disorders (focussing on schizophrenia), introspection, and
  the perception of sound. Questions raised by these topics include "In what way is
  imagination distinct from perception?", "Is there a perceptual relation?", "What
  is the view that perceptual experiences have representational content?", "In what
  way is introspection distinct from perception?", "What does the phenomenon of ''thought
  insertion'' show about the ownership of thoughts?", and "What is a sound?". We explore
  these topics through reading, writing, and presentations by the instructors and
  guests.
