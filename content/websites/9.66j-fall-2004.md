course_description: 'This course is an introduction to computational theories of human
  cognition. Drawing on formal models from classic and contemporary artificial intelligence,
  students will explore fundamental issues in human knowledge representation, inductive
  learning and reasoning. What are the forms that our knowledge of the world takes?
  What are the inductive principles that allow us to acquire new knowledge from the
  interaction of prior knowledge with observed data? What kinds of data must be available
  to human learners, and what kinds of innate knowledge (if any) must they have?
