course_description: 'This course covers the analysis and design at a molecular scale
  of materials used in contact with biological systems, including biotechnology and
  biomedical engineering. Topics include molecular interactions between bio- and synthetic
  molecules and surfaces; design, synthesis, and processing approaches for materials
  that control cell functions; and application of state-of-the-art materials science
  to problems in tissue engineering, drug delivery, vaccines, and cell-guiding surfaces.
