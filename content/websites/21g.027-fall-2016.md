course_description: "We will explore images that pertain to the emergence of Japan\
  \ as a modern state. We will focus on images that depict Japan as it comes into\
  \ contact with the rest of the world after its long and deep isolation during the\
  \ feudal period.\_We will also cover city planning of Tokyo that took place after\
  \ WWII, and such topics as the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nA unique feature of this\
  \ offering is that we will run it concurrently with the edX MOOC and two University\
  \ of Tokyo MOOCs, Visualizing Postwar Tokyo and Four Faces of Contemporary Japanese\
  \ Architecture, for much of the remainder of the class.\n"
