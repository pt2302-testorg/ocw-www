course_description: 'In the past building prototypes of electronic components for
  new projects/products was limited to using protoboards and wirewrap. Manufacturing
  a printed-circuit-board was limited to final production, where mistakes in the implementation
  meant physically cutting traces on the board and adding wire jumpers - the final
  products would have these fixes on them! Today that is no longer the case, while
  you will still cut traces and use jumpers when debugging a board, manufacturing
  a new final version without the errors is a simple and relatively inexpensive task.
  For that matter, manufacturing a prototype printed circuit board which you know
  is likely to have errors but which will get the design substantially closer to the
  final product than a protoboard setup is not only possible, but desirable. In this
  class, you''ll learn to design, build, and debug printed-circuit-boards.
