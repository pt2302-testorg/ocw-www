course_description: 'This course explores a range of contemporary scholarship oriented
  to the study of ''cybercultures,'' with a focus on research inspired by ethnographic
  and more broadly anthropological perspectives. Taking anthropology as a resource
  for cultural critique, the course will be organized through a set of readings chosen
  to illustrate central topics concerning the cultural and material practices that
  comprise digital technologies. We''ll examine social histories of automata and automation;
  the trope of the ''cyber'' and its origins in the emergence of cybernetics during
  the last century; cybergeographies and politics; robots, agents and humanlike machines;
  bioinformatics and artificial life; online sociality and the cyborg imaginary; ubiquitous
  and mobile computing; ethnographies of research and development; and geeks, gamers
  and hacktivists. We''ll close by considering the implications for all of these topics
  of emerging reconceptualizations of sociomaterial relations, informed by feminist
  science and technology studies.
