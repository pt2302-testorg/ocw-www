course_description: 'This course focuses on neural structures and mechanisms mediating
  the detection, localization and recognition of sounds. Discussions cover how acoustic
  signals are coded by auditory neurons, the impact of these codes on behavioral performance,
  and the circuitry and cellular mechanisms underlying signal transformations. Topics
  include temporal coding, neural maps and feature detectors, learning and plasticity,
  and feedback control. General principles are conveyed by theme discussions of auditory
  masking, sound localization, musical pitch, speech coding, and cochlear implants.
