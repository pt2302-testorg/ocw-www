course_description: 'This course examines computers anthropologically, as artifacts
  revealing the social orders and cultural practices that create them. Students read
  classic texts in computer science along with cultural analyses of computing history
  and contemporary configurations. It explores the history of automata, automation
  and capitalist manufacturing; cybernetics and WWII operations research; artificial
  intelligence and gendered subjectivity; robots, cyborgs, and artificial life; creation
  and commoditization of the personal computer; the growth of the Internet as a military,
  academic, and commercial project; hackers and gamers; technobodies and virtual sociality.
  Emphasis is placed on how ideas about gender and other social differences shape
  labor practices, models of cognition, hacking culture, and social media.
