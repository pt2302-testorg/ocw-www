course_description: "This intensive micro-subject provides the necessary skills in\
  \ Microsoft\xAE Excel spreadsheet modeling for ESD.71 _Engineering Systems Analysis\
  \ for Design_. Its purpose is to bring entering students up to speed on some of\
  \ the advanced techniques that we routinely use in analysis. It is motivated by\
  \ our experience that many students only have an introductory knowledge of Excel,\
  \ and thus waste a lot of time thrashing about unproductively. Many people think\
  \ they know Excel, but overlook many efficient tools, such as Data Table and Goal\
  \ Seek. It is also useful for a variety of other subjects.\n"
