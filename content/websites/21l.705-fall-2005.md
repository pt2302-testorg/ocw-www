course_description: 'For some reason, American literature (like French, Irish, and
  Russian, among others) has been especially productive in major works in fictional
  forms shorter than the novel. Our task in this course will be to survey that field,
  by looking at particular moments of high accomplishment. We will, in addition, consider
  some of the ways in which literary formulae can be used and varied, and some of
  the impacts of elements of narrative construction.
