course_description: 'Still photography, a practice and form of expression that has
  worked its way into every facet of social life and every culture in the world, is
  considered here from the perspectives of history and social science. We will discuss
  the uses and functions of pictures; how they are to be understood and interpreted;
  whether they have clear-cut content and meanings; how they shape and are shaped
  by politics, economics, and social life.
