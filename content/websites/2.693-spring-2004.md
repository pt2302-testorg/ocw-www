course_description: 'This course introduces theoretical and practical principles of
  design of oceanographic sensor systems. Topics include: transducer characteristics
  for acoustic, current, temperature, pressure, electric, magnetic, gravity, salinity,
  velocity, heat flow, and optical devices; limitations on these devices imposed by
  ocean environments; signal conditioning and recording; noise, sensitivity, and sampling
  limitations; and standards. Lectures by experts cover the principles of state-of-the-art
  systems being used in physical oceanography, geophysics, submersibles, acoustics.
  For lab work, day cruises in local waters allow students to prepare, deploy and
  analyze observations from standard oceanographic instruments.
