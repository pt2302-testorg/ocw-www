course_description: 'What was the early modern economy like, and how did monetization
  impact artistic production, consumption, and the afterlife of objects? This seminar-format
  class explores major topics and themes concerning interconnections between early
  modern artistic and architectural creation and the economy. We will approach capitalism
  not as an inevitable system, but rather as a particular historical formation. Core
  course themes: commodification, production, and consumption, using case studies
  of the impact of the mercantile economy on chapels; palaces; prints and paintings,
  and their replication; and other material objects, including coins.
