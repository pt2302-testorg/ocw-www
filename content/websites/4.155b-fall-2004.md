course_description: 'This studio will investigate the social, programmatic, tectonic
  and phenomenological performance and character of a student gathering place on the
  MIT campus. Whether it is simply for socializing or for more specific events, the
  student gathering place will serve as a refuge from the vigorous educational environment
  of the Institute, and it will reinforce a critical sense of "place" through the
  almost logical organization of its program. The place will foster a casual discovery
  of "being": a reflection upon the student''s own existence based upon participation
  in group events and an intellectual attitude toward acting. To create a space that
  inspires, rather than imposes: such a discovery is the foremost challenge of this
  studio.
