course_description: 'With increasing public awareness of the multiple effects of global
  environmental change, the terms water, energy, and food crisis have become widely
  used in scientific and political debates on sustainable development and environmental
  policy. Although each of these crises has distinct drivers and consequences, providing
  sustainable supplies of water, energy, and food are deeply interrelated challenges
  and require a profound understanding of the political, socioeconomic, and cultural
  factors that have historically shaped these interrelations at a local and global
  scale.
