course_description: "This course places contemporary youth activities in perspective\
  \ by surveying young American's political participation over the past 200 years.\
  \ Each week, students will look at trends in youth political activism during a specific\
  \ historical period, as well as what difference\u2014if any\u2014youth media production\
  \ and technology use (radio, music, automobiles, ready-made clothing) made in determining\
  \ the course of events. A central theme in accounts of political participation by\
  \ those who have not yet reached the age of majority are the opportunities for mobilization\
  \ and expression that new technologies supply. This class explores what is truly\
  \ new about \"new media\" and reviews lessons from history for present-day activists\
  \ based on patterns of past failure and success.\n"
