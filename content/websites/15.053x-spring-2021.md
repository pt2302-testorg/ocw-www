course_description: 'This course will examine optimization through a business analytics
  lens. Students will learn the theoretical aspects of linear programming, basic Julia
  programming, and proficiency with linear and nonlinear solvers. Theoretical components
  of the course are made approachable and require no formal background in linear algebra
  or calculus.


  The primary focus of the course is optimization modeling. As a six-week subject,
  it covers about half of the material of the MIT OpenCourseWare version, [15.053
  Spring 2013](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-053-optimization-methods-in-management-science-spring-2013/index.htm?utm_source=OLL&utm_medium=about-page&utm_content=15-053x&utm_campaign=OLL2ocw).
  The topics of the 2013 subject were optimization modeling, algorithms, and theory.


  As part of the [Open Learning Library (OLL)](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/),
  this course is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll if you want
  to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.
  Resources on OLL allow learners to learn at their own pace while receiving immediate
  feedback through interactive content and exercises.'
