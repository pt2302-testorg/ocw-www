course_description: 'This class, required of all Master of Architecture students,
  presents a critical review of works, theories, and polemics in architecture in the
  aftermath of World War II. The aim is to present a historical understanding of the
  period, and to develop a meaningful framework to assess contemporary issues in architecture.
  Special attention will be paid to historiographic questions of how architects construe
  the terms of their "present."
