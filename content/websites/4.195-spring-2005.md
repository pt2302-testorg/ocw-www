course_description: 'This class focuses on representation tools used by architects
  during the design process and attempts to discuss the relationship they develop
  with the object of design. Representation plays a key role in architectural design,
  not only as a medium of conveying and narrating a determined meaning or a preconceived
  idea, but also as a code of creating new meaning, while the medium seeks to establish
  a relationship with itself. In this sense, mediums of representation, as external
  parameters to the design process, are not neutral tools of translating an idea into
  its concrete form. They are neither authentic means of creativity, nor vapid carriers
  of an idea. Therefore, an important aspect in issues of meaning is how the architect
  manipulates the play of translating a concept to its concrete version, through the
  use of a medium of representation. The course is a continuation of the equivalent
  course taught in the fall semester and specifically focuses on digital media. The
  course is intended to establish a reciprocal relationship with the design studio,
  feeding from and contributing to its content.
