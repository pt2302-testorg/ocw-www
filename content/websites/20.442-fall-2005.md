course_description: 'This course, intended for both graduate and upper level undergraduate
  students, will focus on understanding of the basic molecular structural principles
  of biological materials. It will address the molecular structures of various materials
  of biological origin, such as several types of collagen, silk, spider silk, wool,
  hair, bones, shells, protein adhesives, GFP, and self-assembling peptides. It will
  also address molecular design of new biological materials applying the molecular
  structural principles. The long-term goal of this course is to teach molecular design
  of new biological materials for a broad range of applications. A brief history of
  biological materials and its future perspective as well as its impact to the society
  will also be discussed. Several experts will be invited to give guest lectures.
