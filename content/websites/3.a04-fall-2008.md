course_description: 'Physical metallurgy encompasses the relationships between the
  composition, structure, processing history and properties of metallic materials.
  In this seminar you''ll be introduced to metallurgy in a particularly "physical"
  way. We will do blacksmithing, metal casting, machining, and welding, using both
  traditional and modern methods. The seminar meets once per week for an evening laboratory
  session, and once per week for discussion of issues in materials science and engineering
  that tie in to the laboratory work. Students will begin by completing some specified
  projects and progress to designing and fabricating one forged and one cast piece.
