course_description: 'This is a foundation subject in modern software development techniques
  for engineering and information technology. The design and development of component-based
  software (using C# and .NET) is covered; data structures and algorithms for modeling,
  analysis, and visualization; basic problem-solving techniques; web services; and
  the management and maintenance of software. Includes a treatment of topics such
  as sorting and searching algorithms; and numerical simulation techniques. Foundation
  for in-depth exploration of image processing, computational geometry, finite element
  methods, network methods and e-business applications. This course is a core requirement
  for the Information Technology M. Eng. program.


  This class was also offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.470J.
  In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical
  Engineering), and the 13.470J designation was dropped in lieu of 2.159J.
