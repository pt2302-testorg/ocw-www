  (6.431), but the assignments differ. 6.041/6.431 introduces students to the modeling,
  quantification, and analysis of uncertainty. Topics covered include: formulation
  and solution in sample space, random variables, transform techniques, simple random
  processes and their probability distributions, Markov processes, limit theorems,
  and elements of statistical inference.
