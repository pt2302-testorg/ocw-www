course_description: "1.012 introduces students to the theory, tools, and techniques\
  \ of engineering design and creative problem-solving, as well as design issues and\
  \ practices in civil engineering. The course includes several design cases, with\
  \ an emphasis on built facilities (e.g., buildings, bridges and roads). Project\
  \ design explicitly concerns technical approaches as well as consideration of the\
  \ existing built environment, natural environment, economic and social factors,\
  \ and expected life span. A large design case is introduced, which is used in the\
  \ subsequent specialty area design subjects (1.031, 1.041,\_1.051) and the capstone\
  \ design subject (1.013)."
