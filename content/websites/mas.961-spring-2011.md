  those in the social and economic sciences. The goal of the course is to equip students
  with conceptual tools that can help them understand complex systems that emerge
  in both nature and social systems. This is a course intended for a general audience
  and will discuss applications of networks and complexity to diverse systems, including
  epidemic spreading, social networks and the evolution of economic development.
