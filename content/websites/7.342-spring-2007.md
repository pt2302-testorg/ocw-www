course_description: 'How do we communicate with the outside world? How are our senses
  of vision, smell, taste and pain controlled at the cellular and molecular levels?
  What causes medical conditions like allergies, hypertension, depression, obesity
  and various central nervous system disorders? G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
  provide a major part of the answer to all of these questions. GPCRs constitute the
  largest family of cell-surface receptors and in humans are encoded by more than
  1,000 genes. GPCRs convert extracellular messages into intracellular responses and
  are involved in essentially all physiological processes. GPCR dysfunction results
  in numerous human disorders, and over 50% of all prescription drugs on the market
  today directly or indirectly target GPCRs.


  In this course, we will discuss GPCR signal transduction pathways, GPCR oligomerization
  and the diseases caused by GPCR dysfunction. We will study the structure and function
  of rhodopsin, a dim-light photoreceptor and a well-studied GPCR that converts light
  into electric impulses sent to the brain and leads to vision. We will also discuss
  how mutations in rhodopsin cause retinal degeneration and congenital night blindness.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
