course_description: 'This course is an introduction to electromagnetism and electrostatics.
  Topics include: electric charge, Coulomb''s law, electric structure of matter, conductors
  and dielectrics, concepts of electrostatic field and potential, electrostatic energy,
  electric currents, magnetic fields, Ampere''s law, magnetic materials, time-varying
  fields, Faraday''s law of induction, basic electric circuits, electromagnetic waves,
  and Maxwell''s equations. The course has an experimental focus, and includes several
  experiments that are intended to illustrate the concepts being studied.
