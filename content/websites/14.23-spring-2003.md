course_description: "The objective of this course is to introduce you to the role\
  \ of government in markets where competitive equilibria \u201Cfail.\u201D In this\
  \ course we will emphasize the importance of market structure and industrial performance,\
  \ including the strategic interaction of firms. We will examine the behavior of\
  \ individual markets in some detail, focusing on cost analysis, the determinants\
  \ of market demand, investment behavior, market power, and the implications of government\
  \ regulatory behavior. The course will be broken into three parts. In the first\
  \ part, we will review firm behavior and the theory of the market. Here, we will\
  \ discuss perfectly competitive markets (our \u201Cbenchmark\u201D), efficiency,\
  \ market structure, strategic competition, and productivity. Once the foundations\
  \ of the market are well understood, we will then move on to the second part of\
  \ the course, where we will study \u201Ceconomic\u201D regulation. Here, we will\
  \ look at the behavior of natural monopolies and regulatory options for dealing\
  \ with them. And in the third part of the course, we will study \u201Csocial\u201D\
  \ regulation\u2014focusing on environmental, health, and safety regulation.\n"
