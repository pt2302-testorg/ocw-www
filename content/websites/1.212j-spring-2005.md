course_description: 'Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) represent a major transition
  in transportation on many dimensions. This course considers ITS as a lens through
  which one can view many transportation and societal issues. ITS is an international
  program intended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of surface transportation
  systems through advanced technologies in information systems, communications, and
  sensors. In the United States, ITS represents the major post-Interstate-era program
  for advancing surface transportation in highways and public transportation, and
  is potentially comparable to the air traffic control system in impact. The readings
  for the class come primarily from the instructor''s own text: Sussman, Joseph. [_Perspectives
  on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)_](http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,4-40109-22-35352196-0,00.html).
