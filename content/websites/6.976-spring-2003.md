course_description: '6.976 covers circuit and system level design issues of high speed
  communication systems, with primary focus being placed on wireless and broadband
  data link applications. Specific circuit topics include transmission lines, high
  speed and low noise amplifiers, VCO''s, and high speed digital circuits. Specific
  system topics include frequency synthesizers, clock and data recovery circuits,
  and GMSK transceivers. In addition to learning analysis skills for the above items,
  students will gain a significant amount of experience in simulating circuits in
  SPICE and systems in CppSim (a custom C++ simulator).
