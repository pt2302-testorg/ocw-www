course_description: 'This course extends fluid mechanic concepts from Unified Engineering
  to the aerodynamic performance of wings and bodies in sub/supersonic regimes. 16.100
  generally has four components: subsonic potential flows, including source/vortex
  panel methods; viscous flows, including laminar and turbulent boundary layers; aerodynamics
  of airfoils and wings, including thin airfoil theory, lifting line theory, and panel
  method/interacting boundary layer methods; and supersonic and hypersonic airfoil
  theory. Course material varies each year depending upon the focus of the design
  problem.
