course_description: 'This course focuses on the fundamentals of tissue and organ response
  to injury from a molecular and cellular perspective. There is a special emphasis
  on disease states that bridge infection, inflammation, immunity, and cancer. The
  systems approach to pathophysiology includes lectures, critical evaluation of recent
  scientific papers, and student projects and presentations.


  This term, we focus on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), chronic-active hepatitis,
  and hepatitis virus infections. In addition to lectures, students work in teams
  to critically evaluate and present primary scientific papers.
