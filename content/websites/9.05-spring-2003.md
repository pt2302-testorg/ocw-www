course_description: 'Surveys general principles and specific examples of motor control
  in biological systems. Emphasizes the neural mechanisms underlying different aspects
  of movement and movement planning. Covers sensory reception, reflex arcs, spinal
  cord organization, pattern generators, muscle function, locomotion, eye movement,
  and cognitive aspects of motor control. Functions of central motor structures including
  cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex considered. Cortical plasticity,
  motor learning and computational approaches to motor control, and motor disorders
  are discussed.
