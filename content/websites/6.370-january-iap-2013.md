course_description: 'This course is conducted as an artificial intelligence programming
  contest in Java. Students work in teams to program virtual robots to play Battlecode,
  a real-time strategy game. Optional lectures are provided on topics and programming
  practices relevant to the game, and students learn and improve their programming
  skills experientially. The competition culminates in a live Battlecode tournament.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
