course_description: "6.004 offers an introduction to the engineering of digital systems.\
  \ Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops a series of building blocks\
  \ \u2014 logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines,\
  \ computers and finally complete systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms\
  \ are explored through a series of design examples.\n\n6.004 is required material\
  \ for any EECS undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital\
  \ systems. A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital\
  \ design, computer architecture and systems. The problem sets and lab exercises\
  \ are intended to give students \"hands-on\" experience in designing digital systems;\
  \ each student completes a gate-level design for a reduced instruction set computer\
  \ (RISC) processor during the semester.\n"
