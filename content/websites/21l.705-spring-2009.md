course_description: 'What does the Genesis story of creation and temptation tell us
  about gender, about heterosexuality, and about the origins of evil? What is the
  nature of God, and how can we account for that nature in a cosmos where evil exists?
  When is rebellion justified, and when is authority legitimate? These are some of
  the key questions that engaged the poet John Milton, and that continue to engage
  readers of his work.
