course_description: 'For students and teams who have started a sustainable-development
  project in D-Lab (EC.701J or EC.720J), Product Engineering Processes (2.009), or
  elsewhere, this class provides a setting to continue developing projects for field
  implementation. Topics covered include prototyping techniques, materials selection,
  design-for-manufacturing, field-testing, and project management. All classwork will
  directly relate to the students'' projects, and the instructor will consult on the
  projects during weekly lab time. There are no exams. Teams are encouraged to enroll
  together.
