course_description: '6.641 examines electric and magnetic quasistatic forms of Maxwell''s
  equations applied to dielectric, conduction, and magnetization boundary value problems.
  Topics covered include: electromagnetic forces, force densities, and stress tensors,
  including magnetization and polarization; thermodynamics of electromagnetic fields,
  equations of motion, and energy conservation; applications to synchronous, induction,
  and commutator machines; sensors and transducers; microelectromechanical systems;
  propagation and stability of electromechanical waves; and charge transport phenomena.
