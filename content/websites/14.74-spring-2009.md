course_description: "This course explores the foundations of policy making in developing\
  \ countries. The goal is to spell out various policy options and to quantify the\
  \ trade-offs between them. We will study the different facets of human development:\
  \ education, health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal\
  \ norms and institutions. This is an empirical class. For each topic, we will study\
  \ several concrete examples chosen from around the world. While studying each of\
  \ these topics, we will ask: What determines the decisions of poor households in\
  \ developing countries? What constraints are they subject to? Is there a scope for\
  \ policy (by government, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations\
  \ (NGOs))? What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?\n\n**MITx\
  \ Online Version**\n\nThis course is part of the Micromaster\u2019s Program in Data,\
  \ Economics, and Design of Policy through MITx Online. The course is entirely free\
  \ to audit, though learners have the option to pay a fee, which is based on the\
