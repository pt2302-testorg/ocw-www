course_description: "This course will explore the current frontiers of the world of\
  \ RNA biology with primary research papers to trace how the original odd detail\
  \ sometimes leads to major discoveries. As we discuss the different transcripts\
  \ and processing events that enable this exciting diversity of RNA functions, we\
  \ invite you to read landmark papers with us, think critically, and ask new questions,\
  \ as we marvel at the wonders of RNA.  \n  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced\
  \ Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
