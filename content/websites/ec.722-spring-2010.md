course_description: 'D-Lab World Prosthetics is a collaboration between the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology and the Jaipur Foot Organization to improve the design,
  manufacture, and distribution of rehabilitation devices in the developing world.
  The course welcomes individuals interested in physical rehabilitation to work on
  multidisciplinary teams of students with bioengineering, mechanical engineering,
  material science, and medical or pre-medical backgrounds. Students will learn about
  the basics of human walking, different types of gait disabilities, as well as the
  technologies that seek to address those disabilities. Patient perspectives and current
  research areas are presented. Lecture topics focus on lower-limb disabilities, including
  polio and above-knee and below-knee amputation, and will cover both developed and
  developing world techniques for overcoming these disabilities. Students form teams
  to design and prototype low-cost orthotic and prosthetic devices, and present their
  work at the end of the course.
