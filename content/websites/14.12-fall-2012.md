course_description: 'Game Theory, also known as Multiperson Decision Theory, is the
  analysis of situations in which the payoff of a decision maker depends not only
  on his own actions but also on those of others. Game Theory has applications in
  several fields, such as economics, politics, law, biology, and computer science.
  In this course, I will introduce the basic tools of game theoretic analysis. In
  the process, I will outline some of the many applications of Game Theory, primarily
  in economics.
