course_description: 'In this course, students study concepts and practice techniques
  of improvisation in solo and ensemble contexts. The course examines relationships
  between improvisation, composition, and performance based in traditional and experimental
  approaches. Hands-on music making will be complemented by discussion of the aesthetics
  of improvisation. Weekly lab sessions support work on musical technique. Guest artist
  / lecturers will engage students through mini-residencies in jazz with film, Indian
  music, electronic music, and blending improvisation with classic music; and an accompanying
  concert series will feature these artists in performance. Open by audition to instrumental
  or vocal performers.
