course_description: 'An advanced course covering anatomical, physiological, behavioral,
  and computational studies of the central nervous system relevant to speech and hearing.
  Students learn primarily by discussions of scientific papers on topics of current
  interest. Recent topics include cell types and neural circuits in the auditory brainstem,
  organization and processing in the auditory cortex, auditory reflexes and descending
  systems, functional imaging of the human auditory system, quantitative methods for
  relating neural responses to behavior, speech motor control, cortical representation
  of language, and auditory learning in songbirds.
