course_description: 'This team-taught multidisciplinary course provides information
  relevant to the conduct and interpretation of human brain mapping studies. It begins
  with in-depth coverage of the physics of image formation, mechanisms of image contrast,
  and the physiological basis for image signals. Parenchymal and cerebrovascular neuroanatomy
  and application of sophisticated structural analysis algorithms for segmentation
  and registration of functional data are discussed. Additional topics include: fMRI
  experimental design including block design, event related and exploratory data analysis
  methods, and building and applying statistical models for fMRI data; and human subject
  issues including informed consent, institutional review board requirements and safety
  in the high field environment.
