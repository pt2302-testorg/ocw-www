course_description: 'This course is intended to introduce graduate students to a set
  of core writings in the field of urban sociology. Topics include the changing nature
  of community, social inequality, political power, socio-spatial change, technological
  change, and the relationship between the built environment and human behavior. We
  examine the key theoretical paradigms that have constituted the field since its
  founding, assess how and why they have changed over time, and discuss the implications
  of these paradigmatic shifts for urban scholarship, social policy and the planning
  practice.
