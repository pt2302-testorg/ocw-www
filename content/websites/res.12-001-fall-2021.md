course_description: "This collection of three essays was developed from the author's\
  \ experience teaching the course *Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean*, offered\
  \ to graduate students entering the [MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](http://mit.whoi.edu/).\
  \ The essays are:\n\n1. Dimensional Analysis of Models and Data Sets: Similarity\
  \ Solutions and Scaling Analysis,\n2. A Coriolis Tutorial, and\n3. Lagrangian and\
  \ Eulerian Representations of Fluid Flow: Kinematics and the Equations of Motion\n\
  \nThe goal of this resource is to help each student master the concepts and mathematical\
  \ tools that make up the foundation of classical and geophysical fluid dynamics.\
  \ These essays treat these topics in considerably greater depth than a comprehensive\
  \ fluids textbook can afford, and they are accompanied by data files (MATLAB\xAE\
  \ and Fortan) that allows some application and experimentation. They should be suitable\
  \ for self-study.\n\nThe 2022 revision of \u201CA Coriolis Tutorial\u201D comes\
  \ in five parts. Part 1 studies the basics of rotating reference frames and the\
  \ Coriolis force, as before. Four new parts examine topics that are central to Geophysical\
  \ Fluid Dynamics: Part 2: Geostrophic adjustment; Part 3: Beta effects. The next\
  \ two parts are increasingly oceanographic: Part 4: Wind-driven ocean circulation;\
  \ and, Part 5: The seasonally-varying Arabian Sea."
