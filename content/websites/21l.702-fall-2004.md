course_description: 'This seminar looks at two bestselling nineteenth-century American
  authors whose works made the subject of slavery popular among mainstream readers.
  _Uncle Tom''s Cabin_ by Harriet Beecher Stowe and _The Adventures of_ _Huckleberry
  Finn_ by Mark Twain have subsequently become canonized and reviled, embraced and
  banned by individuals and groups at both ends of the political and cultural spectrum
  and everywhere in between.
