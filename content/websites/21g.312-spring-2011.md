course_description: "Childhood is a source of fascination in most Western cultures.\
  \ It is both a major inspiration for artistic creation and a political ideal, which\
  \ aims at protecting future generations. Which role does it play in French society\
  \ and in other francophone areas? Why is the French national anthem (\"La Marseillaise\"\
  ) addressed to its \"children\"? This course will study the transformation of childhood\
  \ since the 18th century and the development of sentimentality within the family.\
  \ We will examine various representations of childhood in literature (e.g. Pagnol,\
  \ Proust, Sarraute, Laye, Morgi\xE8vre), movies (e.g. Truffaut), and songs (e.g.\
  \ Brel, Barbara). Course taught in French.\n"
