course_description: 'This course is a survey of significant orchestral masterworks
  composed during three centuries. Listening assignments include 34 symphonies and
  24 concertos, composed from the 1720s to the 1990s. Class discussion and oral presentations
  focus on the works in 18 miniature scores; prior score-reading experience is helpful.
  Each of the three written papers reviews a concert attended during the term. Since
  this is a participatory subject, each student will give oral presentations concerning
  composers and their symphonies and/or concertos.
