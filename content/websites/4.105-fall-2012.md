course_description: 'This course is an intensive introduction to architectural design
  tools and process, and is taught through a series of short exercises. The conceptual
  basis of each exercise is in the interrogation of the geometric principles that
  lie at the core of each skill. Skills covered in this course range from techniques
  of hand drafting, to generation of 3D computer models, physical model-building,
  sketching, and diagramming. Weekly lectures and pin-ups address the conventions
  associated with modes of architectural representation and their capacity to convey
  ideas. This course is tailored and offered only to first-year M.Arch students.
