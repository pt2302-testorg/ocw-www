course_description: 'In 2008, the Beijing Urban Design Studio will focus on the issue
  of Beijing''s urban transformation under the theme of de-industrialization, by preparing
  an urban design and development plan for the Shougang (Capital Steel Factory) site.
  This studio will address whether portions of the old massive factory infrastructure
  can be preserved as a national industrial heritage site embedded into future new
  development; how to balance the cultural and recreational value of the site with
  environmental challenges; as well as how to use the site for urban development.
  A special focus of the studio will be to consider development approaches that minimize
  energy utilization.


  To research these questions, students will be asked to interact with clients from
  the factory, local residents, city officials and experts on transportation, environment,
  energy and real estate. They will assess strategic options for the steel factory
  and propose comprehensive plans for the design and development of the brownfield
  site.
