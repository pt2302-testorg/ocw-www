course_description: "This collection of three essays was developed from the author's\
  \ experience teaching the course _Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean_, offered\
  \ to graduate students entering the [MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](http://mit.whoi.edu/).\
  \ The essays are:  \n  \n1\\. Dimensional Analysis of Models and Data Sets: Similarity\
  \ Solutions and Scaling Analysis,  \n2\\. A Coriolis Tutorial, and  \n3\\. Lagrangian\
  \ and Eulerian Representations of Fluid Flow: Kinematics and the Equations of Motion\
  \  \n  \nThe goal of this resource is to help each student master the concepts and\
  \ mathematical tools that make up the foundation of classical and geophysical fluid\
  \ dynamics. These essays treat these topics in considerably greater depth than a\
  \ comprehensive fluids textbook can afford, and they are accompanied by data files\
  \ (MATLAB\xAE and Fortan) that allows some application and experimentation. They\
  \ should be suitable for self study.\n"
