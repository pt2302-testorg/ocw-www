course_description: 'In this course we will discover how innovative technologies combined
  with profound hypotheses have given rise to our current understanding of neuroscience.
  We will study both new and classical primary research papers with a focus on the
  plasticity between synapses in a brain structure called the hippocampus, which is
  believed to underlie the ability to create and retrieve certain classes of memories.
  We will discuss the basic electrical properties of neurons and how they fire. We
  will see how firing properties can change with experience, and we will study the
  biochemical basis of these changes. We will learn how molecular biology can be used
  to specifically change the biochemical properties of brain circuits, and we will
  see how these circuits form a representation of space giving rise to complex behaviors
  in living animals. A special emphasis will be given to understanding why specific
  experiments were done and how to design experiments that will answer the questions
  you have about the brain.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
