course_description: 'This class is an applications-oriented course covering the modeling
  of large-scale systems in decision-making domains and the optimization of such systems
  using state-of-the-art optimization tools. Application domains include: transportation
  and logistics planning, pattern classification and image processing, data mining,
  design of structures, scheduling in large systems, supply-chain management, financial
  engineering, and telecommunications systems planning. Modeling tools and techniques
  include linear, network, discrete and nonlinear optimization, heuristic methods,
  sensitivity and post-optimality analysis, decomposition methods for large-scale
  systems, and stochastic optimization.


  This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)
  (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5223 (System Optimisation: Models and Computation).
