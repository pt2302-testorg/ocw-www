course_description: "Though the era of British Romanticism (ca. 1790-1830) is sometimes\
  \ exclusively associated with the poetry of these years, this period was just as\
  \ importantly a time of great innovation in British prose fiction.\_Romantic novelists\
  \ pioneered or revolutionized several genres, including social/philosophical problem\
  \ novels, tales of sentiment and sensibility, and the historical novel.\_Writing\
  \ in the years of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic wars, and the early industrial\
  \ revolution, these writers conveyed a spirit of chaos and upheaval even in stories\
  \ whose settings are seemingly farthest removed from those cataclysmic historical\
  \ events.\_In this year's offering of \"Major English Novels,\" we will read of\
  \ plagues, wars, hysterics, monsters and more in novels by authors including William\
  \ Godwin, Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, and Walter Scott.\_In the\
  \ final weeks of the semester, we will read one major novel of the Victorian era,\
  \ Charles Dickens's _Great Expectations_, in light of these earlier texts.\_There\
  \ will be two essay assignments, one 5-7 pages and one 8-10 pages in length, and\
  \ required presentations.\n"
