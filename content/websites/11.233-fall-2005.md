course_description: 'This course covers approaches to research and evaluation in the
  planning field, for those preparing to write 1st-year doctoral and other research
  papers. Topics include narrowing down research interests, using quantitative and
  qualitative techniques complementarily, and interviewing and other fieldwork challenges.
  The course uses a seminar-type format in which readings, class discussions, and
  assignments are built around (1) generic themes that run across the research interests
  and paper topics of students in the class, and (2) lessons about methodology to
  be learned from the case comparison studies assigned.
