course_description: "The STEM Concept Videos are designed to help students learn a\
  \ pivotal concept in science, technology, engineering, and/or mathematics (STEM).\
  \ These ideas are the building blocks of many engineering curricula, and learning\
  \ them will help students master more difficult material. The STEM Concept Videos\
  \ were produced by the [Teaching and Learning Lab](http://tll.mit.edu/) (TLL) at\
  \ MIT for the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\n\nFor more\
  \ information on how these videos were developed, please see the paper presented\
  \ by TLL researchers at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) 2013\
  \ conference.\n\nShah, D.N., JE French, J. Rankin, L. Breslow. \u201C[Using Video\
