course_description: 'Alienation, overcrowding, sensory overload, homelessness, criminality,
  violence, loneliness, sprawl, blight. How have the realities of city living influenced
  literature''s formal and thematic techniques? How useful is it to think of literature
  as its own kind of "map" of urban space? Are cities too grand, heterogeneous, and
  shifting to be captured by writers? In this seminar we will seek answers to these
  questions in key city literature, and in theoretical works that endeavor to understand
  the culture of cities.
