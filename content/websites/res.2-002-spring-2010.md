course_description: 'Finite element analysis is now widely used for solving complex
  static and dynamic problems encountered in engineering and the sciences. In these
  two video courses, [Professor K. J. Bathe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus-J%C3%BCrgen_Bathe),
  a researcher of world renown in the field of finite element analysis, teaches the
  basic principles used for effective finite element analysis, describes the general
  assumptions, and discusses the implementation of finite element procedures for linear
  and nonlinear analyses.


  These videos were produced in 1982 and 1986 by the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering
  Study.
