course_description: "In this class, food serves as both the subject and the object\
  \ of historical analysis. As a subject, food has been transformed over the last\
  \ 100 years, largely as a result of ever more elaborate scientific and technological\
  \ innovations. From a need to preserve surplus foods for leaner times grew an elaborate\
  \ array of techniques \u2013 drying, freezing, canning, salting, etc \u2013 that\
  \ changed not only what people ate, but how far they could/had to travel, the space\
  \ in which they lived, their relations with neighbors and relatives, and most of\
  \ all, their place in the economic order of things. The role of capitalism in supporting\
  \ and extending food preservation and development was fundamental. As an object,\
  \ food offers us a way into cultural, political, economic, and techno-scientific\
  \ history. Long ignored by historians of science and technology, food offers a rich\
  \ source for exploring, e.g., the creation and maintenance of mass-production techniques,\
  \ industrial farming initiatives, the politics of consumption, vertical integration\
  \ of business firms, globalization, changing race and gender identities, labor movements,\
  \ and so forth. How is food different in these contexts, from other sorts of industrial\
  \ goods? What does the trip from farm to table tell us about American culture and\
  \ history?\n"
