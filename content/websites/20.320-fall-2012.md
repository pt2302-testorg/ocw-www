course_description: 'This course focuses on computational and experimental analysis
  of biological systems across a hierarchy of scales, including genetic, molecular,
  cellular, and cell population levels. The two central themes of the course are modeling
  of complex dynamic systems and protein design and engineering. Topics include gene
  sequence analysis, molecular modeling, metabolic and gene regulation networks, signal
  transduction pathways and cell populations in tissues. Emphasis is placed on experimental
  methods, quantitative analysis, and computational modeling.
