course_description: 'A presentation of the fundamentals of modern numerical techniques
  for a wide range of linear and nonlinear elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial
  differential equations and integral equations central to a wide variety of applications
  in science, engineering, and other fields. Topics include: Mathematical Formulations;
  Finite Difference and Finite Volume Discretizations; Finite Element Discretizations;
  Boundary Element Discretizations; Direct and Iterative Solution Methods.


  This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)
  (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5212 (Numerical Methods for Partial Differential
  Equations).
