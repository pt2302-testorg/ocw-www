course_description: "This semester students are asked to transform the Hereshoff Museum\
  \ in Bristol, Rhode Island, through processes of erasure and addition.\_Hereshoff\
  \ Manufacturing was recognized as one of the premier builders of America's Cup racing\
  \ boats between 1890's and 1930's. The studio, however, is about more than the program.\_\
  It is about land, water, and wind and the search for expressing materially and tectonically\
  \ the relationships between these principle conditions. That is, where the land\
  \ is primarily about stasis (docking, anchoring and referencing our locus), water's\
  \ fluidity holds the latent promise of movement and freedom.\_Movement is activated\
  \ by wind, allowing for negotiating the relationship between water and land.\n"
