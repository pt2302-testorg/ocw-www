course_description: 'This class explores sound and what can be done with it. Sources
  are recorded from students'' surroundings - sampled and electronically generated
  (both analog and digital). Assignments include composing with the sampled sounds,
  feedback, and noise, using digital signal processing (DSP), convolution, algorithms,
  and simple mixing. The class focuses on sonic and compositional aspects rather than
  technology, math, or acoustics, though these are examined in varying detail. Students
  complete weekly composition and listening assignments; material for the latter is
  drawn from sound art, experimental electronica, conventional and non-conventional
  classical electronic works, popular music, and previous students'' compositions.
