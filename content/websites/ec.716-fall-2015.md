course_description: 'This introductory course will provide you with a multidisciplinary
  approach to managing waste in low- and middle-income countries, with strategies
  that diminish greenhouse gas emissions and provide enterprise opportunities for
  marginalized populations. You will focus on understanding some of the multiple dimensions
  of waste generation and management. Topics are presented in real contexts through
  case studies, field visits, civic engagement and research, and include consumer
  culture, waste streams, waste management, entrepreneurship and innovation on waste,
  technology evaluation, downcycling / upcycling, Life Cycle Analysis and waste assessment.
  Labs include building low-cost, small scale technology, field trips to waste-related
  institutions and businesses, art workshops and e-waste scrapping taught by practitioners,
  artists and waste enthusiasts.
