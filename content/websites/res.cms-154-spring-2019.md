course_description: "Every great teacher and every great school constantly work towards\
  \ creating better learning conditions for students. Just as we hope our students\
  \ become lifelong learners, we as educators should be constantly learning and improving.\
  \ This education course is for school leaders of all kinds (from teacher-leaders\
  \ to principals to superintendents) who are launching innovation in schools\u2014\
  starting new efforts to work together to improve teaching and learning.\n\nYou will\
  \ complete a cycle of study, experimentation, and reflection to gain confidence\
  \ and skills to lead instructional improvement efforts. Through experiential activities\
  \ and assignments, you will begin working with colleagues to envision the next level\
  \ of work for your team or organization, to launch a new initiative, and to measure\
  \ your progress along the way. Based on the work of Prof. Justin Reich and Dr. Peter\
  \ Senge, this course will focus on visioning and capacity-building, with an emphasis\
  \ on collaboration and building partnerships with stakeholders at multiple levels.\n\
  \nAt the end of the course, you will have started the process of launching an instructional\
  \ improvement initiative in your school or learning environment, and you will better\
  \ understand yourself as a leader and change agent. You will have made connections\
  \ with peers who are also undertaking this important work.\n\nThis course is part\
  \ of the\_[Open Learning Library](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/), which is\
  \ free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course if you want\
  \ to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.\n"
