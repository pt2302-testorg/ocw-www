course_description: 'In this book, Sanjoy Mahajan shows us that the way to master
  complexity is through insight rather than precision. Precision can overwhelm us
  with information, whereas insight connects seemingly disparate pieces of information
  into a simple picture. Unlike computers, humans depend on insight. Based on the
  author''s fifteen years of teaching at MIT, Cambridge University, and Olin College,
  _The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering_ shows us how to build insight and
  find understanding, giving readers tools to help them solve any problem in science
  and engineering. (Description courtesy of MIT Press.)
