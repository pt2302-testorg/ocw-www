course_description: This class is about figuring out together what cities and users
  can do to reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. Many other classes at MIT
  focus on policies, technologies, and systems, often at the national or international
  level, but this course focuses on the scale of cities and users. It is designed
  for any students interested in learning how to intervene in the energy use of cities
  using policy, technology, economics, and urban planning.
