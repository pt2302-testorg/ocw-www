course_description: "Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources\
  \ that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory\
  \ mathematics courses. _Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra_\
  \ is the third course in the series, consisting of 20 Videos, 3 Study Guides, and\
  \ a set of Supplementary Notes. Students should have mastered the first two courses\
  \ in the series ([Single Variable Calculus](/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm)\_\
  and\_[Multivariable Calculus](/resources/res-18-007-calculus-revisited-multivariable-calculus-fall-2011/index.htm))\
  \ before taking this course.\n\nThe series was first released in 1972, but equally\
  \ valuable today for students who are learning these topics for the first time.\n\
  \nAbout the Instructor\n\nHerb Gross has taught math as senior lecturer at MIT and\
  \ was the founding math department chair at Bunker Hill Community College. He is\
  \ the developer of the [Mathematics As A Second Language](http://www.mathasasecondlanguage.org/)\
  \ website, providing arithmetic and algebra materials to elementary and middle school\
  \ teachers.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFunding for this resource was provided by the\
  \ [Gabriella and Paul Rosenbaum Foundation](http://www.rosenbaum-foundation.org/).\n\
