course_description: "How\_\u2014 and why\_\u2014 do people seek to capture everyday\
  \ life on film? What can we learn from such films? This course challenges distinctions\
  \ commonly made between documentary and ethnographic films to consider how human\
  \ cultural life is portrayed in both. It considers the interests, which motivate\
  \ such filmmakers ranging from curiosity about \"exotic\" people to a concern with\
  \ capturing \"real life\" to a desire for advocacy. Students will view documentaries\
  \ about people both in the U.S. and abroad and will consider such issues as the\
  \ relationship between film images and \"reality,\" the tensions between art and\
  \ observation, and the ethical relationship between filmmakers and those they film.\n"
