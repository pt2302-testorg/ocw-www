course_description: 'As events of the last few years have shown, the Supreme Court
  has played a crucial role in American political life. There is practically no issue
  of social significance in the American past that did not at some point end up in
  the nation''s courtrooms, yet much of the workings of the constitution remain obscure.
  This subject is designed to introduce students to the main themes and events of
  American constitutional law since 1787. It introduces terms and concepts of law
  and legal history, focusing on three recurring themes in American public life: liberty,
  equality, and property. Readings consist mostly of original court cases, especially
  from the U.S. Supreme Court, but the focus of the class is on the historical connections
  between those cases and broader social, political, and cultural trends.
