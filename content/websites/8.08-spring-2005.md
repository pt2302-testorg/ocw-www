course_description: 'This course covers probability distributions for classical and
  quantum systems. Topics include: Microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical
  partition-functions and associated thermodynamic potentials. Also discussed are
  conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium for homogenous and heterogenous systems.


  The course follows [8.044](/courses/8-044-statistical-physics-i-spring-2013/), Statistical
  Physics I, and is second in this series of undergraduate Statistical Physics courses.
