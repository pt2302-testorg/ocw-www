course_description: "This five-day interactive and experiential workshop focuses on\
  \ how leaders lead innovations that both promote social responsibility and produce\
  \ business success. The workshop is organized around three main parts: observation,\
  \ sense-making, and creating. During the observation phase, students spend a full\
  \ day inside the Boston office of the design company IDEO and visit some of the\
  \ most interesting proven innovators in corporate social responsibility such as\
  \ Ben & Jerry\u2019s, KLD, MBDC, Plug Power (fuel cell technology), PwC, Schlumberger,\
  \ or core team members of the UN Global Compact. After returning from their company\
  \ visits, students describe to one another what they saw and learned.\_In the final\
  \ part of the Lab, students conceive and implement innovation projects that serve\
  \ the needs of a local community. Each team presents its practical accomplishments\
  \ on the final day of the Lab. Starting in 2004 this course will be renumbered as\
  \ 15.975.\n"
