course_description: "This class is intended to introduce students to understandings\
  \ of the city generated from both social science literature and the field of urban\
  \ design. The first part of the course examines literature on the history and theory\
  \ of the city. Among other factors, it pays special attention to the larger territorial\
  \ settings in which cities emerged and developed (ranging from the global to the\
  \ national to the regional\_context) and how these affected the nature, character,\
  \ and functioning of cities and the lives of their inhabitants. The remaining weeks\
  \ focus more explicitly on the theory and practice of design visions for the city,\
  \ the latter in both utopian and realized form. One of our aims will be to assess\
  \ the conditions under which a variety of design visions were conceived, and to\
  \ assess them in terms of the varying patterns of territorial \"nestedness\" (local,\
  \ regional, national, imperial, and global) examined in the first part of the course.\
  \ Another will be to encourage students to think about the future prospects of cities\
  \ (in terms of territorial context or other political functions and social aims)\
  \ and to offer design visions that might reflect these new dynamics.\n"
