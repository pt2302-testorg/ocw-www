course_description: 'This innovative, trans-faculty subject teaches how information
  technologies (IT) are reshaping and redefining the health care marketplace through
  improved economies of scale, greater technical efficiencies in the delivery of care
  to patients, advanced tools for patient education and self-care, network integrated
  decision support tools for clinicians, and the emergence of e-commerce in health
  care. Student tutorials provide an opportunity for interactive discussion. Interdisciplinary
  project teams comprised of Harvard and MIT graduate students in medicine, business,
  law, education, engineering, computer science, public health, and government collaborate
  to design innovative IT applications. Projects are presented during the final class.


  Starting in Spring 2010, this course will be titled _Enabling Technology Innovation
  in Healthcare and the Life Sciences_.
