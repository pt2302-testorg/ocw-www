course_description: "This course offers an introduction to probability, statistical\
  \ mechanics, and thermodynamics. Numerous examples are used to illustrate a wide\
  \ variety of physical phenomena such as magnetism, polyatomic gases, thermal radiation,\
  \ electrons in solids, and noise in electronic devices.\n\nThis course is an elective\
  \ subject in MIT\u2019s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor).\
  \ This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major\
  \ with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and\
  \ social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n"
