course_description: 'The lethal poison Ricin (best known as a weapon of bioterrorism),
  Diphtheria toxin (the causative agent of a highly contagious bacterial disease),
  and the widely used antibiotic tetracycline have one thing in common: They specifically
  target the cell''s translational apparatus and disrupt protein synthesis.


  In this course, we will explore the mechanisms of action of toxins and antibiotics,
  their roles in everyday medicine, and the emergence and spread of drug resistance.
  We will also discuss the identification of new drug targets and how we can manipulate
  the protein synthesis machinery to provide powerful tools for protein engineering
  and potential new treatments for patients with devastating diseases, such as cystic
  fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
