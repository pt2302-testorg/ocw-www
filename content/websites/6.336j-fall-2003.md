course_description: '6.336J is an introduction to computational techniques for the
  simulation of a large variety of engineering and physical systems. Applications
  are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, electrical, chemical and biological engineering,
  and materials science. Topics include: mathematical formulations; network problems;
  sparse direct and iterative matrix solution techniques; Newton methods for nonlinear
  problems; discretization methods for ordinary, time-periodic and partial differential
  equations, fast methods for partial differential and integral equations, techniques
  for dynamical system model reduction and approaches for molecular dynamics.


  This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/)
  (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5211 (Introduction to Numerical Simulation).
