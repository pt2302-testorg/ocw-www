course_description: 'This course teaches students how to understand the rationality
  behind how organizations and their programs behave, and to be comfortable and analytical
  with a live organization. It thereby builds analytic skills for evaluating programs
  and projects, organizations, and environments. It draws on the literature of the
  sociology of organizations, political science, public administration, and historical
  experience-and is based on both developing-country and developed-country experience.
