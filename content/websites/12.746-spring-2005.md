course_description: 'This class is designed to provide the student with a global to
  molecular-level perspective of organic matter cycling in the oceans and marine sediments.
  Topics include: Organic matter (C,N,P) composition, reactivity and budgets within,
  and fluxes through, major ocean reservoirs; microbial recycling pathways for organic
  matter; models of organic matter degradation and preservation; role of anoxia in
  organic matter burial; relationships between dissolved and particulate (sinking
  and suspended) organic matter; methods for characterization of sedimentary organic
  matter; and application of biological markers as tools in oceanography. Both structural
  and isotopic aspects are covered.
