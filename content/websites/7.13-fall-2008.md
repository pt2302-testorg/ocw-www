course_description: "In this class, students engage in independent research projects\
  \ to probe various aspects of the physiology of the bacterium\__Pseudomonas aeruginosa_\
  \ PA14, an opportunistic pathogen isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.\
  \ Students use molecular genetics to examine survival in stationary phase, antibiotic\
  \ resistance, phase variation, toxin production, and secondary metabolite production.\n\
  \nProjects aim to discover the molecular basis for these processes using both classical\
  \ and cutting-edge techniques. These include plasmid manipulation, genetic complementation,\
  \ mutagenesis, PCR, DNA sequencing, enzyme assays, and gene expression studies.\
  \ Instruction and practice in written and oral communication are also emphasized.\n\
  \n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in these materials are potentially\
  \ hazardous and require a high level of safety training, special facilities and\
  \ equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals. You bear the sole responsibility,\
  \ liability, and risk for the implementation of such safety procedures and measures.\
  \ MIT shall have no responsibility, liability, or risk for the content or implementation\
  \ of any of the material presented.  \n  \n[Legal Notice](/terms/)\n"
