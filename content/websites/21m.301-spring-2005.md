course_description: 'In this subject we will study the basic harmonic, melodic, and
  formal practices of western music, principally the classical music of central Europe
  during the eighteenth century. Topics will include diatonic harmony, simple counterpoint
  in two parts, and tones of figuration. The coursework will combine composition,
  listening, analysis, and work in sight-singing and keyboard musicianship.
