course_description: 'This course introduces abstraction as an important mechanism
  for problem decomposition and solution formulation in the biomedical domain, and
  examines computer representation, storage, retrieval, and manipulation of biomedical
  data. As part of the course, we will briefly examine the effect of programming paradigm
  choice on problem-solving approaches, and introduce data structures and algorithms.
  We will also examine knowledge representation schemes for capturing biomedical domain
  complexity and principles of data modeling for efficient storage and retrieval.
  The final project involves building a medical information system that encompasses
  the different concepts taught in the course.


  Computer science basics covered in the first part of the course are integral to
  understanding topics covered in the latter part, and for completing the assigned
  homework.
