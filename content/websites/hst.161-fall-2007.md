course_description: 'This course provides a foundation for understanding the relationship
  between molecular biology, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics,
  and medicine. It develops explicit connections between basic research, medical understanding,
  and the perspective of patients. Principles of human genetics are reviewed. We translate
  clinical understanding into analysis at the level of the gene, chromosome and molecule;
  we cover the concepts and techniques of molecular biology and genomics, and the
  strategies and methods of genetic analysis, including an introduction to bioinformatics.
  Material in the course extends beyond basic principles to current research activity
  in human genetics.
