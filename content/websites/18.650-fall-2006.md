course_description: 'This course offers a broad treatment of statistics, concentrating
  on specific statistical techniques used in science and industry. Topics include:
  hypothesis testing and estimation, confidence intervals, chi-square tests, nonparametric
  statistics, analysis of variance, regression, and correlation.


  OCW offers an earlier version of this course, from Fall 2003. This newer version
  focuses less on estimation theory and more on multiple linear regression models.
  In addition, a number of Matlab examples are included here.
