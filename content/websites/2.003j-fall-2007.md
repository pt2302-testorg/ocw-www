course_description: "This class is an introduction to the dynamics and vibrations\
  \ of lumped-parameter models of mechanical systems. Topics include kinematics; force-momentum\
  \ formulation for systems of particles and rigid bodies in planar motion; work-energy\
  \ concepts; virtual displacements and virtual work; Lagrange's equations for systems\
  \ of particles and rigid bodies in planar motion; linearization of equations of\
  \ motion; linear stability analysis of mechanical systems; free and forced vibration\
  \ of linear multi-degree of freedom models of mechanical systems; and matrix eigenvalue\
  \ problems. The class includes an introduction to numerical methods and using MATLAB\xAE\
  \ to solve dynamics and vibrations problems.\n\nThis version of the class stresses\
  \ kinematics and builds around a strict but powerful approach to kinematic formulation\
  \ which is different from the approach presented in Spring 2007. Our notation was\
  \ adapted from that of Professor Kane of Stanford University.\n"
