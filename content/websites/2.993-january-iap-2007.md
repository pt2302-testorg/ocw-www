course_description: 'This class is jointly sponsored by the MIT Museum, Massachusetts
  Bay Maritime Artisans, the Department of Mechanical Engineering''s Center for Ocean
  Engineering, and the Department of Architecture. The course teaches the fundamental
  steps in traditional boat design and demonstrates connections between craft and
  modern methods. Instructors provide vessel design orientation and then students
  carve their own shape ideas in the form of a wooden half-hull model. Experts teach
  the traditional skills of visualizing and carving your model in this phase of the
  class. After the models are completed, a practicing naval architect guides students
  in translating shape from models into a lines plan. The final phase of the class
  is a comparative analysis of the designs generated by the group.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
