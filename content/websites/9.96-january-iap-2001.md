course_description: 'Students will be exposed to all aspects of a cutting-edge technique
  in modern electrophysiology, in a highly structured, team oriented environment.
  The research projects will probe the neural mechanisms of learning and memory through
  tetrode array recordings coupled with patterned microstimulation. Due to the broad
  nature of tasks to be completed, coupled with the team oriented approach we will
  be employing, we are interested in students with a wide variety of laboratory experience
  and skill levels.
