course_description: 'The goal of the Climate Primer website is to summarize the most
  important lines of evidence for human-caused climate change. It confronts the stickier
  questions about uncertainty in our projections, engages in a discussion of risk
  and risk managment, and concludes by presenting different options for taking action.
  We hope that the facts prepare you for more effective conversations with your community
  about values, trade-offs, politics, and actions.
