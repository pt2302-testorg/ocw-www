course_description: 'This course is organized around algorithmic issues that arise
  in machine learning. Modern machine learning systems are often built on top of algorithms
  that do not have provable guarantees, and it is the subject of debate when and why
  they work. In this class, we focus on designing algorithms whose performance we
  can rigorously analyze for fundamental machine learning problems.
