course_description: 'How and why do we participate in public life? How do we get drawn
  into community and political affairs? In this course we examine the associations
  and networks that connect us to one another and structure our social and political
  interactions. Readings are drawn from a growing body of research suggesting that
  the social networks, community norms, and associational activities represented by
  the concepts of civil society and social capital can have important effects on the
  functioning of democracy, stability and change in political regimes, the capacity
  of states to carry out their objectives, and international politics.
