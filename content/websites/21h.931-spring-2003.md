course_description: 'This subject is designed to give 21H majors and minors an introduction
  to the methods that historians use to interpret the past. We will focus on two areas:
  archives and interpretation. In our work on archives, we will ask what constitutes
  an archive. We will visit one or two local archives, speak with archivists, and
  assemble our own archive related to life at MIT in 2003. Once we have a better understanding
  of the possibilities and limitations of historical archives, we will turn to the
  task of interpreting archival findings. We will discuss a series of readings organized
  around the theme of history and national identity in various parts of the world
  since the end of the eighteenth century.
