course_description: 'This design-based subject provides a first course in energy and
  thermo-sciences with applications to sustainable energy-efficient architecture and
  building technology. No previous experience with subject matter is assumed. After
  taking this subject, students will understand introductory thermodynamics and heat
  transfer, know the leading order factors in building energy use, and have creatively
  employed their understanding of energy fundamentals and knowledge of building energy
  use in innovative building design projects. This year, the focus will be on design
  projects that will complement the new NSTAR/MIT [campus efficiency program](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/nstar-mit-0526.html).
