course_description: '6.101 is an introductory experimental laboratory that explores
  the design, construction, and debugging of analog electronic circuits. Lectures
  and six laboratory projects investigate the performance characteristics of diodes,
  transistors, JFETs, and op-amps, including the construction of a small audio amplifier
  and preamplifier. Seven weeks are devoted to the design and implementation, and
  written and oral presentation of a project in an environment similar to that of
  engineering design teams in industry. The course provides opportunity to simulate
  real-world problems and solutions that involve trade offs and the use of engineering
  judgment. Engineers from local analog engineering companies come to campus to help
  students with their design projects.
