course_description: 'This course will teach fundamentals of control design and analysis
  using state-space methods. This includes both the practical and theoretical aspects
  of the topic. By the end of the course, you should be able to design controllers
  using state-space methods and evaluate whether these controllers are robust to some
  types of modeling errors and nonlinearities. You will learn to:


  *   Design controllers using state-space methods and analyze using classical tools.

  *   Understand impact of implementation issues (nonlinearity, delay).

  *   Indicate the robustness of your control design.

  *   Linearize a nonlinear system, and analyze stability.
