course_description: 'This course studies what makes a good design and how one develops
  a good design. Students consider how the design of engineered systems (such as hardware,
  software, materials, and manufacturing systems) differ from the "design" of natural
  systems such as biological systems; discuss complexity and how one makes use of
  complexity theory to improve design; and discover how one uses axiomatic design
  theory (AD theory) in design of many different kinds of engineered systems. Questions
  are analyzed using Axiomatic Design Theory and Complexity Theory. Case studies are
  presented including the design of machines, tribological systems, materials, manufacturing
  systems, and recent inventions. Implications of AD and complexity theories on biological
  systems discussed.
