course_description: 'This course examines the changes in contemporary French society
  through the study of political debates, reforms and institutions since 1958, and
  analyzes the deep influence of politics on cultural and social life, despite a decline
  in political participation. Public controversies and political cleavages, from the
  Algerian war to postcolonial issues, from the birth of the European Union to the
  recent financial crisis, and from the moral "revolution" of the seventies to the
  recognition of new families are revisited.


  This course is taught in English.
