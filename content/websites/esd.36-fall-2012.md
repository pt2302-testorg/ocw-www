  to effectively plan and implement successful system and product development projects.
  Material is divided into four major sections: project preparation, planning, monitoring,
  and adaptation. Brief review of classical techniques such as CPM and PERT. Emphasis
  on new methodologies and tools such as Design Structure Matrix (DSM), probabilistic
  project simulation, as well as project system dynamics (SD). Topics are covered
