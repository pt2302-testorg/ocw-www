course_description: 'This course will begin with brief overview of what important
  current research topics are in oceanography (physical, geological, and biological)
  and how acoustics can be used as a tool to address them. Three typical examples
  are climate, bottom geology, and marine mammal behavior. Will then address the acoustic
  inverse problem, reviewing inverse methods (linear and nonlinear) and the combination
  of acoustical methods with other measurements as an integrated system. Last part
  of course will concentrate on specific case studies, taken from current research
  journals. This course is taught on campus at MIT and with simultaneous video at
  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
