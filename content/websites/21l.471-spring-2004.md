course_description: "This course studies several important examples of the genre that\
  \ between the early 18th century and the end of the 20th has come to seem the definitive\
  \ literary form for representing and coming to terms with modernity. Syllabi vary,\
  \ but the class usually attempts to convey a sense of the form's development over\
  \ the past few centuries. Among topics likely to be considered are: developments\
  \ in narrative technique, the novel's relation to history, national versus linguistic\
  \ definitions of an \"English\" novel, social criticism in the novel, realism versus\
  \ \"romance,\" the novel's construction of subjectivities. Writers studied have\
  \ included Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, Samuel Richardson, Lawrence Sterne, Mary\
  \ Shelley, Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Emily and Charlotte Bront\xEB, Charles Dickens,\
  \ George Eliot, Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Salman\
  \ Rushdie.\n"
