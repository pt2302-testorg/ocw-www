course_description: "This course examines the opportunities and risks firms face in\
  \ today's global world. The course provides conceptual tools for analyzing how governments\
  \ and a variety of social and economic institutions influence competition among\
  \ firms embedded in different national settings. Public policies and institutions\
  \ that shape competitive outcomes are examined through cases and analytic readings\
  \ on different companies and industries operating in both developed and emerging\
  \ markets.\_ In addition to traditional case/class discussions, this course will\
  \ include some presentations by various guest speakers. The hope is that greater\
  \ exposure to/interaction with these real-world practitioners will \"bring to life\"\
  \ some of the issues discussed in the readings/cases. Whenever possible, informal\
  \ dinners and/or coffees will be organized for small groups of students interested\
  \ in meeting with our guest speakers.\n"
