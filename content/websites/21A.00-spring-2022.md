course_description: Through the comparative study of different cultures, anthropology
  explores fundamental questions about what it means to be human. It seeks to understand
  how culture shapes societies, from the smallest island in the South Pacific to the
  largest Asian metropolis, and affects the way institutions work, from scientific
  laboratories to Christian megachurches. This course will provide a framework for
  analyzing diverse facets of human experience, such as gender, ethnicity, language,
  politics, economics, and art.
