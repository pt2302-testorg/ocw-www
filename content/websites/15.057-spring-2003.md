course_description: 'Managers and engineers are constantly attempting to optimize,
  particularly in the design and operation of complex systems. This course is an application-oriented
  introduction to (systems) optimization. It seeks to:


  *   Motivate the use of optimization models to support managers and engineers in
  a wide variety of decision making situations;

  *   Show how several application domains (industries) use optimization;

  *   Introduce optimization modeling and solution techniques (including linear, non-linear,
  integer, and network optimization, and heuristic methods);

  *   Provide tools for interpreting and analyzing model-based solutions (sensitivity
  and post-optimality analysis, bounding techniques); and

  *   Develop the skills required to identify the opportunity and manage the implementation
  of an optimization-based decision support tool.
