course_description: 'This is the second in a sequence of two field seminars in American
  politics intended for graduate students in political science, in preparation for
  taking the general examination in American politics. The material covered in this
  semester focuses on American political institutions. The readings covered here are
  not comprehensive, but it is sufficiently broad to give students an introduction
  to major empirical questions and theoretical approaches that guide the study of
  American political institutions these days.
