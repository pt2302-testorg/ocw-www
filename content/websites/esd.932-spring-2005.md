course_description: 'Technology Policy Organizations and its sequel, ESD.933, Technology
  Policy Negotiations and Dispute Resolution, form a sequence on Organizational Processes
  in Technology Policy. This course features an overall framework for understanding
  the increasingly networked, flat, flexible and diverse nature of organizations,
  as well as a close look at the many relevant types of organizations, including regulatory,
  entrepreneurial, multi-national, and non-governmental non-profit. Key organizational
  processes, including individual motivation, teamwork, and systems change are featured.
  The core assignment features a series of industry studies in which students conduct
  field interviews (in phone or in person) of key stakeholders on a pressing policy
  challenge in that industry and analyze the impact of organizational factors on policy
  success.
