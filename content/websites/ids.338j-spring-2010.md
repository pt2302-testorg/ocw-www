course_description: 'There is need for a rigorous, quantitative multidisciplinary
  design methodology that works with the non-quantitative and creative side of the
  design process in engineering systems. The goal of multidisciplinary systems design
  optimization is to create advanced and complex engineering systems that must be
  competitive not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of life-cycle value.
  The objective of the course is to present tools and methodologies for performing
  system optimization in a multidisciplinary design context. Focus will be equally
  strong on all three aspects of the problem: (i) the multidisciplinary character
  of engineering systems, (ii) design of these complex systems, and (iii) tools for
  optimization.
