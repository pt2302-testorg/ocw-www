course_description: 'This course is an introduction to basic ideas of geophysical
  wave motion in rotating, stratified, and rotating-stratified fluids. Subject begins
  with general wave concepts of phase and group velocity. It also covers the dynamics
  and kinematics of gravity waves with a focus on dispersion, energy flux, initial
  value problems, etc.
