course_description: 'The aim of this course is to introduce the principles of the
  Global Positioning System and to demonstrate its application to various aspects
  of Earth Sciences. The specific content of the course depends each year on the interests
  of the students in the class. In some cases, the class interests are towards the
  geophysical applications of GPS and we concentrate on high precision (millimeter
  level) positioning on regional and global scales. In other cases, the interests
  have been more toward engineering applications of kinematic positioning with GPS
  in which case the concentration is on positioning with slightly less accuracy but
  being able to do so for a moving object. In all cases, we concentrate on the fundamental
  issues so that students should gain an understanding of the basic limitations of
  the system and how to extend its application to areas not yet fully explored.
