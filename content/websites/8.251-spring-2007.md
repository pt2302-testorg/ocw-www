course_description: 'This course introduces string theory to undergraduate and is
  based upon Prof. Zwiebach''s textbook entitled _A First Course in String Theory_.
  Since string theory is quantum mechanics of a relativistic string, the foundations
  of the subject can be explained to students exposed to both special relativity and
  basic quantum mechanics. This course develops the aspects of string theory and makes
  it accessible to students familiar with basic electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.
