course_description: 'This course examines how a variety of cultural traditions propose
  answers to the question of how to live a meaningful life. It considers the meaning
  of life, not as a philosophical abstraction, but as a question that individuals
  grapple with in their daily lives, facing difficult decisions between meeting and
  defying cultural expectations. The course also provides tools for thinking about
  moral decisions as social and historical practices, and permits students to compare
  and contextualize the ways people in different times and places approach fundamental
  ethical concerns.
