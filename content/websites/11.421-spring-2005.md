course_description: 'This class focuses on how the housing and human service systems
  interact: how networks and social capital can build between elements of the two
  systems. It explores ways in which the differing world views, professional perspectives,
  and institutional needs of the two systems play out operationally. Part I establishes
  the nature of the action frames of these two systems. Part II applies these insights
  to particular vulnerable groups: "at risk" households in transitional housing, the
  chronically mentally ill, and the frail elderly.
