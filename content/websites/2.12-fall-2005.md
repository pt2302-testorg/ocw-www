course_description: 'This course provides an overview of robot mechanisms, dynamics,
  and intelligent controls. Topics include planar and spatial kinematics, and motion
  planning; mechanism design for manipulators and mobile robots, multi-rigid-body
  dynamics, 3D graphic simulation; control design, actuators, and sensors; wireless
  networking, task modeling, human-machine interface, and embedded software. Weekly
  laboratories provide experience with servo drives, real-time control, and embedded
  software. Students will design and fabricate working robotic systems in a group-based
  term project.
