course_description: 'Treatment of the laws of thermodynamics and their applications
  to equilibrium and the properties of materials. Provides a foundation to treat general
  phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism,
  polarizability, and elasticity. Develops relations pertaining to multiphase equilibria
  as determined by a treatment of solution thermodynamics. Develops graphical constructions
  that are essential for the interpretation of phase diagrams. Treatment includes
  electrochemical equilibria and surface thermodynamics. Introduces aspects of statistical
  thermodynamics as they relate to macroscopic equilibrium phenomena.
