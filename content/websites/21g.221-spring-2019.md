  \ examine how various aspects of American culture\u2014history, geography, institutions,\
  \ traditions, values\u2014have shaped dominant Anglo-American communication norms\
  \ and responses to critical events in the world. In addition, you can expect to\
  \ practice and strengthen your analytical and communication skills in a carefully\
  \ scaffolded manner, starting with frequent short writing and speaking tasks and\
  \ progressing to longer, more formal tasks.\n"
