course_description: 'This is an advanced graduate-level seminar that will analyze
  the effectiveness of development and planning theories from the perspective of practitioners
  who implement projects and policies based on such theories. The course will be organized
  around 12 implementation puzzles, which should be considered for re-theorizing both
  developmental and planning processes.
