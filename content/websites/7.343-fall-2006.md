course_description: "In this course, you will journey through the web of physical,\
  \ chemical, and biological reactions that collectively constitute photosynthesis.\
  \ We will begin with light harvesting and follow photons to the sites of primary\
  \ photochemistry: the photoreaction centers. A molecular-scale view will show in\
  \ atomic detail how these protein complexes capture and energize electrons. Then\
  \ we will follow the multiple pathways electrons take as they carry out their work.\
  \ Consequent reactions, such as the synthesis of ATP and the reduction of CO\u2082\
  \ during the synthesis of carbohydrates, will also be discussed in structural detail.\
  \ Lastly, we will delve into the evolution of these systems and also discuss other\
  \ photosynthetic strategies, such as light-driven proton pumps and anoxygenic photosynthesis.\
  \ The course will include a visit to an electron microscope to allow students to\
  \ directly observe proteins involved in photosynthesis.\n\nThis course is one of\
  \ many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching."
