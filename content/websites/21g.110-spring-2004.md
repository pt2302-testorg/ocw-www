course_description: 'This is the second semester of the intermediate level sequence
  intended for students whose conversational ability exceeds their reading and writing
  skills. Focus is on reading and writing, as well as broadening conversational skills
  and control of standard pronunciation, for students with background in conversational
  Chinese. Lab work is required. On completing this course, students should be able
  to speak the language with standard pronunciation, to converse with some fluency
  on everyday topics, as well as on some specialized topics, to read edited, as well
  as authentic texts, in simplified or traditional characters with suitable fluency,
  and to be able to write composition on certain topics. The class consists of a combination
  of practice, reading, discussion, dictation, composition and feedback, net exploration
  via the web, and presentation. This course is conducted in Mandarin.
