course_description: 'One objective of 15.066J is to introduce modeling, optimization
  and simulation, as it applies to the study and analysis of manufacturing systems
  for decision support. The introduction of optimization models and algorithms provide
  a framework to think about a wide range of issues that arise in manufacturing systems.
  The second objective is to expose students to a wide range of applications for these
  methods and models, and to integrate this material with their introduction to operations
  management.
