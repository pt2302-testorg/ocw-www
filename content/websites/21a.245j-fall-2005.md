course_description: 'Using examples from anthropology and sociology alongside classical
  and contemporary social theory, this course explores the nature of dominant and
  subordinate relationships, types of legitimate authority, and practices of resistance.
  The course also examines how we are influenced in subtle ways by the people around
  us, who makes controlling decisions in the family, how people get ahead at work,
  and whether democracies, in fact, reflect the "will of the people."
