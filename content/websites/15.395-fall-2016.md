course_description: 'This course examines opportunities and problems for entrepreneurs
  globally, including Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Linkages between the business
  environment, the institutional framework, and new venture creation are covered with
  a special focus on blockchain technology. In addition to discussing a range of global
  entrepreneurial situations, student groups pick one particular cluster on which
  to focus and to understand what further development would entail. Classroom interactions
  are based primarily on case studies.
