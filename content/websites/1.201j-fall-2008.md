course_description: 'The main objective of this course is to give broad insight into
  the different facets of transportation systems, while providing a solid introduction
  to transportation demand and cost analyses. As part of the core in the Master of
  Science in Transportation program, the course will not focus on a specific transportation
  mode but will use the various modes to apply the theoretical and analytical concepts
  presented in the lectures and readings.


  Introduces transportation systems analysis, stressing demand and economic aspects.
  Covers the key principles governing transportation planning, investment, operations
  and maintenance. Introduces the microeconomic concepts central to transportation
  systems. Topics covered include economic theories of the firm, the consumer, and
  the market, demand models, discrete choice analysis, cost models and production
  functions, and pricing theory. Application to transportation systems include congestion
  pricing, technological change, resource allocation, market structure and regulation,
  revenue forecasting, public and private transportation finance, and project evaluation;
  covering urban passenger transportation, freight, aviation and intelligent transportation
  systems.
