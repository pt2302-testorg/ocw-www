course_description: "What is the good life, and can you shop there? Would you want\
  \ that life if you couldn't? Has shopping replaced working as the activity that\
  \ gives the most meaning to our lives? The theme for this Expository Writing class\
  \ is Consumer Culture. The class will explore what it means to belong to a consumer\
  \ society\u2014to think of ourselves, as Douglas Rushkoff puts it, less as citizens\
  \ than as consumers. Readings will serve both as examples of effective writing techniques\
  \ and as springboards for discussion. We\u2019ll read essays that explore a variety\
  \ of cultural meanings of shopping and that analyze the way advertising works. We\
  \ will also read essays that critique consumer culture from several perspectives,\
  \ including those of psychology, gender, art, environmentalism and ethics. Readings\
  \ and essay assignments will invite you to reflect on personal, familial and cultural\
  \ meanings of shopping; to analyze advertisements; and to join in conversation with\
  \ critics of consumer culture and offer your own critiques.\n"
