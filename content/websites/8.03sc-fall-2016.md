course_description: "Vibrations and waves are everywhere. If you take any system and\
  \ disturb it from a stable equilibrium, the resultant motion will be waves and vibrations.\
  \ Think of a guitar string\u2014pluck the string, and it vibrates. The sound waves\
  \ generated make their way to our ears, and we hear the string\u2019s sound. Our\
  \ eyes see what\u2019s happening because they receive the electromagnetic waves\
  \ of the light reflected from the guitar string, so that we can recognize the beautiful\
  \ sinusoidal waves on the string. In fact, without vibrations and waves, we could\
  \ not recognize the universe around us at all!\n\n[![Click to get started.](/images/button_start.png)](pages/syllabus)\n\
  \nThe amazing thing is that we can describe many fascinating phenomena arising from\
  \ very different physical systems with mathematics. This course will provide you\
  \ with the concepts and mathematical tools necessary to understand and explain a\
  \ broad range of vibrations and waves. You will learn that waves come from many\
  \ interconnected (coupled) objects when they are vibrating together. We will discuss\
  \ many of these phenomena, along with related topics, including mechanical vibrations\
  \ and waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, optics, and gravitational waves.\n"
