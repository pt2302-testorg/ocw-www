course_description: "This course is designed to provide students with a broad overview\
  \ of the major theories on the relationship between ethnicity and politics. The\
  \ course is divided into three sections. The first covers general theory and discusses\
  \ the social construction of ethnicity as well as the limits of construction. The\
  \ second section discusses ethnicity as a dependent variable. This section studies\
  \ the forces that shape the development of ethnic identities and their motivating\
  \ power. The third section addresses ethnicity as an independent variable. In other\
  \ words, it focuses on how ethnicity operates to affect important political and\
  \ economic outcomes.\n\nThis course is the first semester of a year-long sequence\
  \ on ethnic politics. However, each semester is self-contained and students may\
  \ take the course in either or both semesters. Ethnic Politics I aims for breadth\
  \ over depth. It covers many works in the \u201Ccanon\u201D of texts on ethnic politics\
  \ as well as addressing many major topics (modernization, entrepreneurship, prejudice,\
  \ ethnic party formation, etc.) in one week sessions. Ethnic Politics II covers\
  \ some of these topics in greater depth and also requires a major research paper.\n"
