course_description: 'With the growing availability and lowering costs of genotyping
  and personal genome sequencing, the focus has shifted from the ability to obtain
  the sequence to the ability to make sense of the resulting information. This course
  is aimed at exploring the computational challenges associated with interpreting
  how sequence differences between individuals lead to phenotypic differences in gene
  expression, disease predisposition, or response to treatment.
