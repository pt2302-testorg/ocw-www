course_description: "This course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\_\
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting.\n\nIn 1971, President\
  \ Nixon declared the \"War on Cancer,\" but after three decades the war is still\
  \ raging. How much progress have we made toward winning the war and what are we\
  \ doing to improve the fight? Understanding the molecular and cellular events involved\
  \ in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis is crucial to the development\
  \ of innovative therapy for cancer patients. Insights into these processes have\
  \ been gleaned through basic research using biochemical, molecular, and genetic\
  \ analysis in yeast, C. elegans, mice, and cell culture models. We will explore\
  \ the laboratory tools and techniques used to perform cancer research, major discoveries\
  \ in cancer biology, and the medical implications of these breakthroughs. A focus\
  \ of the class will be critical analysis of the primary literature to foster understanding\
  \ of the strengths and limitations of various approaches to cancer research. Special\
  \ attention will be made to the clinical implications of cancer research performed\
  \ in model organisms and the prospects for ending the battle with this devastating\
  \ disease.\n"
