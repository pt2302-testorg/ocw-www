course_description: 'Many details of phonetic realization cannot be predicted from
  standard phonological representations on a language-independent basis, so phonetic
  realization must be specified in grammar. In this seminar we will investigate phonetic
  realization as a component of grammar.


  The basic questions that we will address are:


  *   What is the form of the phonetic realization component?

  *   What is its relationship to phonology?
