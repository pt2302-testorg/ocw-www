course_description: 'This subject is on regional energy-environmental modeling rather
  than on general energy-environmental policies, but the models should have some policy
  relevance. We will start with some discussion of green accounting issues; then,
  we will cover a variety of theoretical and empirical topics related to spatial energy
  demand and supply, energy forecasts, national and regional energy prices, and environmental
  implications of regional energy consumption and production. Where feasible, the
  topics will have a spatial dimension. This is a new seminar, so we expect students
  to contribute material to the set of readings and topics covered during the semester.
