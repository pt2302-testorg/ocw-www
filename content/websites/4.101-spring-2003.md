course_description: 'This course uses scale models to design environments that orchestrate
  contrasting material properties and conventional constructional systems to create
  places that foster specific ways of inhabiting space. It also demonstrates how architecture
  differs from other forms of design. Intended for students to test aptitude for architectural
  design and to experience an unfamiliar mode of thought, it''s conducted in a studio
  format, with lectures on architectural theory and history, and structured for students
  with no previous experience in design.


  Required of Architecture majors.
