course_description: 'The theoretical frameworks of Hartree-Fock theory and density
  functional theory are presented in this course as approximate methods to solve the
  many-electron problem. A variety of ways to incorporate electron correlation are
  discussed. The application of these techniques to calculate the reactivity and spectroscopic
  properties of chemical systems, in addition to the thermodynamics and kinetics of
  chemical processes, is emphasized. This course also focuses on cutting edge methods
  to sample complex hypersurfaces, for reactions in liquids, catalysts and biological
  systems.
