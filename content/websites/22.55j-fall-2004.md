course_description: 'The central theme of this course is the interaction of radiation
  with biological material. The course is intended to provide a broad understanding
  of how different types of radiation deposit energy, including the creation and behavior
  of secondary radiations; of how radiation affects cells and why the different types
  of radiation have very different biological effects. Topics will include: the effects
  of radiation on biological systems including DNA damage; in vitro cell survival
  models; and in vivo mammalian systems. The course covers radiation therapy, radiation
  syndromes in humans and carcinogenesis. Environmental radiation sources on earth
  and in space, and aspects of radiation protection are also discussed. Examples from
  the current literature will be used to supplement lecture material.
