course_description: "This course, along with [_21G.107 / 157 Chinese I (Streamlined)_](/courses/21g-107-chinese-i-streamlined-fall-2014/)\
  \ offered in the previous fall, form the elementary level of the streamlined sequence,\
  \ which is intended for students who, when they began the sequence at beginning\
  \ level, had basic conversational skills (gained, typically, from growing up in\
  \ a Chinese speaking environment), but lacked a corresponding level of literacy.\
  \ The focus of the course is on standard usage, on reading in both traditional and\
  \ simplified characters, and on writing. The course is conducted entirely in Chinese.\n\
  \nStreamlined I and II\u2014each section is limited to 16 students for pedagogical\
  \ purposes. Pre-registered students have priority. Continuing students get first\
  \ priority, followed, in order, by students in 21G.076, declared concentrators and\
  \ minors, sophomores, freshmen, juniors, seniors, and graduate students. Pre-registered\
  \ students who did not show up for the first two days of class without warning will\
  \ be eliminated. Students beginning their studies of Chinese language at MIT above\
  \ the elementary level must contact the Chinese instructors for a placement test.\
  \ No auditors allowed.\n"
