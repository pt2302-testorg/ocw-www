course_description: This course introduces academic debates on the nature of capitalism,
  drawing upon the ideas of scholars as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. It examines
  anthropological studies of how contemporary capitalism plays out in people's daily
  lives in a range of geographic and social settings, and implications for how we
  understand capitalism today. Settings range from Wall Street investment banks to
  auto assembly plants, from family businesses to consumer shopping malls.
