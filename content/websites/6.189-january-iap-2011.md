course_description: 'This course will provide a gentle, yet intense, introduction
  to programming using Python for highly motivated students with little or no prior
  experience in programming. The course will focus on planning and organizing programs,
  as well as the grammar of the Python programming language.


  The course is designed to help prepare students for [_6.01 Introduction to EECS
  I_](/courses/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/).
  6.01 assumes some knowledge of Python upon entering; the course material for 6.189
  has been specially designed to make sure that concepts important to 6.01 are covered.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.'
