course_description: 'This course discusses the basics every manager needs to organize
  successful technology-driven innovation in both entrepreneurial and established
  firms. We start by examining innovation-based strategies as a source of competitive
  advantage and then examine how to build organizations that excel at identifying,
  building and commercializing technological innovations. Major topics include how
  the innovation process works; creating an organizational environment that rewards
  innovation and entrepreneurship; designing appropriate innovation processes (e.g.
  stage-gate, portfolio management); organizing to take advantage of internal and
  external sources of innovation; and structuring entrepreneurial and established
  organizations for effective innovation. The course examines how entrepreneurs can
  shape their firms so that they continuously build and commercialize valuable innovations.
  Many of the examples also focus on how established firms can become more entrepreneurial
  in their approach to innovation.
