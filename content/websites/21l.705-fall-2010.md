course_description: "Global exploration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\
  \ radically changed Western science, orienting philosophies of natural history to\
  \ more focused fields like comparative anatomy, botany, and geology. In the United\
  \ States, European scientific advances and home-grown ventures like the Wilkes Exploring\
  \ Expedition to Antarctica and the Pacific inspired new endeavors in cartography,\
  \ ethnography, zoology, and evolutionary theory, replacing rigid models of thought\
  \ and classification with more fluid and active systems. They inspired literary\
  \ authors as well. This class will examine some of the most remarkable of these\
  \ authors\u2014Herman Melville (_Moby-Dick_ and \"The Encantadas\"), Henry David\
  \ Thoreau (_Walden_), Sarah Orne Jewett (_Country of the Pointed Firs_), Edith Wharton\
  \ (_House of Mirth_), Toni Morrison (_A Mercy_), among others\u2014in terms of the\
  \ subjects and methods they adopted, imaginatively and often critically, from the\
  \ natural sciences.\n"
