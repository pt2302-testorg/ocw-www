course_description: 'This class continues our study of the foundational texts of human
  culture, focusing on early modernity until the recent past. In many ways, this includes
  several questions such as: Why did these works achieve the fame and influence they
  achieved? How do they present what it means to be a human being? How do they describe
  the role of a member of a family, community, tradition, social class, gender? How
  do they distinguish between proper and improper behavior? How do they characterize
  the members of other groups? However, in several ways, these texts are also iconoclastic,
  breaking with centuries of established tradition to shed light on previously unexplored
  subjects, such as the status of women in society or the legacy of the colonial expansion
  of European countries. They also question well-established social beliefs like religion,
  monarchical rule and human nature in general.
