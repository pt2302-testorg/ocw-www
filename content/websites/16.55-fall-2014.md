course_description: 'This course highlights the properties and behavior of low-temperature
  plasmas in relation to energy conversion, plasma propulsion, and gas lasers. The
  course includes material on the equilibrium (energy states, statistical mechanics,
  and relationship to thermodynamics) and kinetic theory of ionized gases (motion
  of charged particles, distribution function, collisions, characteristic lengths
  and times, cross sections, and transport properties). In addition, the course discusses
  gas surface interactions (thermionic emission, sheaths, and probe theory) and radiation
  in plasmas and diagnostics.
