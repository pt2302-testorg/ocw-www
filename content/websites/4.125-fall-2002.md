course_description: '4.125 is the third undergraduate design studio. This subject
  introduces skills needed to build within a landscape establishing continuities between
  the built and natural world. Students learn to build appropriately through analysis
  of landscape and climate for a chosen site, and to conceptualize design decisions
  through drawings and models.
