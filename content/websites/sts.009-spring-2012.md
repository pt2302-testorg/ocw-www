course_description: 'This course provides a broad conceptual and historical introduction
  to scientific theories of evolution and their place in the wider culture. It embraces
  historical, scientific and anthropological/cultural perspectives grounded in relevant
  developments in the biological sciences since 1800 that are largely responsible
  for the development of the modern theory of evolution by natural selection. Students
  read key texts, analyze key debates (e.g. Darwinian debates in the 19th century,
  and the creation controversies in the 20th century) and give class presentations.
