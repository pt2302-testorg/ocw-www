course_description: 'This course is an examination of the theory, the practice, and
  the implications of rhetoric & rhetorical criticism. This semester, you will have
  the opportunity to deepen many of your skills: Analysis, persuasion, oral presentation,
  and critical thinking. In this course you will act as both a rhetor (a person who
  uses rhetoric to persuade) and as a rhetorical critic (one who analyzes the rhetoric
  of others). Both the rhetor and the rhetorical critic write to persuade; both ask
  and answer important questions. Always one of their goals is to create new knowledge
  for all of us, so no endeavor in this class is a "mere exercise."
