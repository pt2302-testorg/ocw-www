course_description: 'This course provides a systematic presentation of the chemical
  applications of group theory with emphasis on the formal development of the subject
  and its applications to the physical methods of inorganic chemical compounds. Against
  the backdrop of electronic structure, the electronic, vibrational, and magnetic
  properties of transition metal complexes are presented and their investigation by
  the appropriate spectroscopy described.
