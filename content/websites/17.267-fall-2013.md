course_description: 'This course examines the functioning of democracy in the U.S.
  beginning with the theoretical foundations of democratic representation. It explores
  how the views of the public influence policy making. It also examines factors, such
  as malapportionment, that lead to non-majoritarian outcomes. Evidence on how well
  policy outcomes reflect public opinion is reviewed, and whether certain groups are
  over or under-represented in the policy process. Also discussed are reforms that
  might make our democracy more responsive to the American public.
