course_description: 'Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able
  to:


  *   Create lumped parameter models (expressed as ODEs) of simple dynamic systems
  in the electrical and mechanical energy domains

  *   Make quantitative estimates of model parameters from experimental measurements

  *   Obtain the time-domain response of linear systems to initial conditions and/or
  common forcing functions (specifically; impulse, step and ramp input) by both analytical
  and computational methods

  *   Obtain the frequency-domain response of linear systems to sinusoidal inputs

  *   Compensate the transient response of dynamic systems using feedback techniques

  *   Design, implement and test an active control system to achieve a desired performance
  measure


  Mastery of these topics will be assessed via homework, quizzes/exams, and lab assignments.
