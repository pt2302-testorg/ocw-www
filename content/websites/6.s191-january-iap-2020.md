course_description: 'This is MIT''s introductory course on deep learning methods with
  applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more!
  Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical
  experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Course concludes with a project
  proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors. Prerequisites
  assume calculus (i.e. taking derivatives) and linear algebra (i.e. matrix multiplication),
  and we''ll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is
  helpful but not necessary.
