course_description: 'The core of this seminar will be the great sequences of English
  love sonnets written by William Shakespeare, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, and
  Mary Wroth. These poems cover an enormous amount of aesthetic and psychological
  ground: ranging from the utterly subjective to the entirely public or conventional,
  from licit to forbidden desires, they might also serve as a manual of experimentation
  with the resources of sound, rhythm, and figuration in poetry. Around these sequences,
  we will develop several other contexts, using both Renaissance texts and modern
  accounts: the Petrarchan literary tradition (poems by Francis Petrarch and Sir Thomas
  Wyatt); the social, political, and ethical uses of love poetry (seduction, getting
  famous, influencing policy, elevating morals, compensating for failure); other accounts
  of ideal masculinity and femininity (conduct manuals, theories of gender and anatomy);
  and the other limits of the late sixteenth century vogue for love poetry: narrative
  poems, pornographic poems, poems that don''t work.
