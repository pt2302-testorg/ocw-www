course_description: 'The primary purpose of this seminar is to enable students to
  craft approaches to so-called "First World"/ "Third World" city comparisons that
  are theoretically sophisticated, methodologically rigorous, contextually grounded,
  and significantly beneficial. Since there exists very little literature and very
  few projects which compare "First World" and "Third World" cities in a sophisticated
  and genuinely useful manner, the seminar is structured around a series of readings,
  case studies, and discussions to assist students in becoming mindful of the potential
  and pitfalls of comparative analysis, the types of data, the methods of analysis,
  and the urban issues or sectors which may benefit the most from such approaches.
  The course is designed to be interdisciplinary and interactive, and is geared towards
  masters and doctoral students.
