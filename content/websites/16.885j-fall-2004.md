course_description: "Aircraft are complex products comprised of many subsystems which\
  \ must meet demanding customer and operational lifecycle value requirements. This\
  \ course adopts a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic systems\
  \ engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance; safety and\
  \ reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and management;\
  \ and system realization. Small\_student teams \"retrospectively analyze\" an existing\
  \ aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions; aircraft attributes and subsystems;\
  \ and\_operational experience. Finally, the student teams\_deliver\_oral and written\
  \ versions of the case study.\n"
