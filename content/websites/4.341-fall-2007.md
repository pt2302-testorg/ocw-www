course_description: 'This course provides practical instruction in the fundamentals
  of analog and digital SLR and medium/large format camera operation, film exposure
  and development, black and white darkroom techniques, digital imaging, and studio
  lighting.


  This semester we will explore the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences
  for our theme- and site-specific term project, which provides opportunities to develop
  technical skills and experimental photographic techniques, and for personal artistic
  exploration. Final projects will be presented on site in exhibition format.


  Work in progress is continuously presented and discussed in a critical forum. Lectures,
  readings, visiting professionals, group discussions, and site visits encourage aesthetic
  appreciation of the medium and a deeper understanding of our semester theme, as
  well as a critical awareness of how images in our culture are produced and constructed.
