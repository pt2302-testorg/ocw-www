course_description: 'This course has several purposes. The major concern will be the
  examination of Spanish culture including Spain''s history, architecture, art, literature
  and film, to determine if there is a uniquely Spanish manner of seeing and understanding
  the world - one which emerges as clearly distinct from our own and that of other
  Western European nations.
