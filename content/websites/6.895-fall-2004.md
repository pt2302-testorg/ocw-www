course_description: 'This course introduces the theory of error-correcting codes to
  computer scientists. This theory, dating back to the works of Shannon and Hamming
  from the late 40''s, overflows with theorems, techniques, and notions of interest
  to theoretical computer scientists. The course will focus on results of asymptotic
  and algorithmic significance. Principal topics include:


  1.  Construction and existence results for error-correcting codes.

  2.  Limitations on the combinatorial performance of error-correcting codes.

  3.  Decoding algorithms.

  4.  Applications in computer science.
