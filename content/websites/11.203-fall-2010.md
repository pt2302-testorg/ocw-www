course_description: 'Microeconomics will ground you in - surprise - basic microeconomics-how
  markets function, how to think about allocating scarce resources among competing
  uses, what profit maximizing behavior means in industries with different numbers
  of competitors, how technology and trade reshapes the opportunities people face,
  and so on. We will apply economic ideas to understand current economic problems,
  including the housing bubble, the current unemployment situation (particularly for
  high school gradutes), how Google makes its money and why healthcare costs are rising
  so fast.
