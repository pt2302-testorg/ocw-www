course_description: 'Numerical methods for solving problems arising in heat and mass
  transfer, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction engineering, and molecular simulation.
  Topics: Numerical linear algebra, solution of nonlinear algebraic equations and
  ordinary differential equations, solution of partial differential equations (e.g.
  Navier-Stokes), numerical methods in molecular simulation (dynamics, geometry optimization).
  All methods are presented within the context of chemical engineering problems. Familiarity
  with structured programming is assumed.
