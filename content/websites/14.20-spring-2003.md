course_description: 'This is a course in industrial organization, the study of firms
  in markets. Industrial organization focuses on firm behavior in imperfectly competitive
  markets, which appear to be far more common than the perfectly competitive markets
  that were the focus of your basic microeconomics course. This field analyzes the
  acquisition and use of market power by firms, strategic interactions among firms,
  and the role of government competition policy. We will approach this subject from
  both theoretical and applied perspectives.
