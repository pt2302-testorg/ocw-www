course_description: 'Although attention will be devoted to the causes and long-term
  consequences of the Civil War, this class will focus primarily on the war years
  (1861-1865) with special emphasis on the military and technological aspects of the
  conflict. Four questions, long debated by historians, will receive close scrutiny:


  1.  What caused the war?

  2.  Why did the North win the war?

  3.  Could the South have won?

  4.  To what extent is the Civil War America''s "defining moment"?
