course_description: 'This course teaches simple reasoning techniques for complex phenomena:
  divide and conquer, dimensional analysis, extreme cases, continuity, scaling, successive
  approximation, balancing, cheap calculus, and symmetry. Applications are drawn from
  the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Examples include
  bird and machine flight, neuron biophysics, weather, prime numbers, and animal locomotion.
  Emphasis is on low-cost experiments to test ideas and on fostering curiosity about
  phenomena in the world.
