course_description: '8.06 is the third course in the three-sequence physics undergraduate
  Quantum Mechanics curriculum. By the end of this course, you will be able to interpret
  and analyze a wide range of quantum mechanical systems using both exact analytic
  techniques and various approximation methods. This course will introduce some of
  the important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including two-dimensional
  electron systems, the fine structure of Hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering.
