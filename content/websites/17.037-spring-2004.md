course_description: 'This course surveys American political thought from the colonial
  era to the present. Required readings are drawn mainly from primary sources, including
  writings of politicians, activists, and theorists. Topics include the relationship
  between religion and politics, rights, federalism, national identity, republicanism
  versus liberalism, the relationship of subordinated groups to mainstream political
  discourse, and the role of ideas in politics. We will analyze the simultaneous radicalism
  and weakness of American liberalism, how the revolutionary ideas of freedom and
  equality run up against persistent patterns of inequality. Graduate students are
  expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through suggested reading and individual
  research.
