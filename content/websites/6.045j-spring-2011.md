course_description: 'This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the
  central ideas of theoretical computer science. Beginning in antiquity, the course
  will progress through finite automata, circuits and decision trees, Turing machines
  and computability, efficient algorithms and reducibility, the P versus NP problem,
  NP-completeness, the power of randomness, cryptography and one-way functions, computational
  learning theory, and quantum computing. It examines the classes of problems that
  can and cannot be solved by various kinds of machines. It tries to explain the key
  differences between computational models that affect their power.
