course_description: 'This course explores the complex interrelationships among humans
  and natural environments, focusing on non-western parts of the world in addition
  to Europe and the United States. It uses environmental conflict to draw attention
  to competing understandings and uses of "nature" as well as the local, national
  and transnational power relationships in which environmental interactions are embedded.
  In addition to utilizing a range of theoretical perspectives, this subject draws
  upon a series of ethnographic case studies of environmental conflicts in various
  parts of the world.
