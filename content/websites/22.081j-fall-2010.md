course_description: 'This class assesses current and potential future energy systems,
  covering resources, extraction, conversion, and end-use technologies, with emphasis
  on meeting regional and global energy needs in the 21st century in a sustainable
  manner. Instructors and guest lecturers will examine various renewable and conventional
  energy production technologies, energy end-use practices and alternatives, and consumption
  practices in different countries. Students will learn a quantitative framework to
  aid in evaluation and analysis of energy technology system proposals in the context
  of engineering, political, social, economic, and environmental goals. Students taking
  the graduate version, _Sustainable Energy_, complete additional assignments.
