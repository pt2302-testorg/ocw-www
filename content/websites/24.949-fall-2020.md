course_description: 'This course focuses on the process by which native speakers of
  a language acquire the ability to speak and understand that language. It covers
  some of the major results in the study of first-language acquisition, concentrating
  on morpho-syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The findings primarily come from English,
  but cross-linguistic differences in the phenomena of interest and corresponding
  differences in acquisition patterns are considered where appropriate. Of interest
  throughout is how these developmental data inform linguistic theory and/or learnability
  theory.
