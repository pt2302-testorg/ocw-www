course_description: '6.883 is a graduate seminar that investigates a variety of program
  analysis techniques that address software engineering tasks. Static analysis topics
  include abstract interpretation (dataflow), type systems, model checking, decision
  procedures (SAT, BDDs), theorem-proving. Dynamic analysis topics include testing,
  fault isolation (debugging), model inference, and visualization. While the course
  focuses on the design and implementation of programming tools, the material will
  be useful to anyone who wishes to improve his or her programming or understand the
  state of the art. Students are expected to read classic and current technical papers,
  actively participate in class discussion, perform small exercises that provide experience
  with a variety of tools, and complete a team research project.
