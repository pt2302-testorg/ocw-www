course_description: "This class is a multidisciplinary introduction to pharmacology,\
  \ neurotransmitters, drug mechanisms, and brain diseases from addiction to schizophrenia.\n\
  \nFrom Abilify\xAE to Zyrtec\xAE, the world is full of fascinating drugs. If you\
  \ are poisoned by sarin nerve gas, you may be able to save your life by huffing\
  \ some BZ nerve gas. This class will explain that chemical curiosity, along with\
  \ a host of other interesting tidbits of pharmacology. The structure of the class\
  \ interleaves basic concepts with specific examples and entertaining tangents, so\
  \ it is not loaded with boring abstract theory. In the first class you will learn\
  \ what a neurotransmitter is, and you will immediately apply that knowledge when\
  \ we discuss the mechanism of caffeine. The class is highly multidisciplinary, including\
  \ topics such as patent law, medical ethics, history, and the physics of crack pipes.\n"
