course_description: "This class is developed around the concept of disobedient interference\
  \ within the existing models of production of space and knowledge.\n\nModeling is\
  \ the main _modus operandi_ of the class as students will be required to make critical\
  \ diagrammatic cuts through processes of production in different thematic registers\
  \ \u2013 from chemistry, law and economy to art, architecture and urbanism \u2013\
  \ in order to investigate the sense of social responsibility and control over the\
  \ complex agendas embedded in models that supports production of everyday objects\
  \ and surroundings. Students will be encouraged to explore relations between material\
  \ or immaterial aspects and agencies of production, whether they emerged as a consequence\
  \ of connection of mind, body and space, or the infrastructural, geographical and\
  \ ecological complexities of the Anthropocene. These production environments will\
  \ be taken as modeling settings.\n"
