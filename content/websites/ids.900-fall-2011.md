course_description: "IDS.900 _Doctoral Seminar in Engineering Systems_ examines the\
  \ core theory and contextual applications of the emerging field of Engineering Systems.\
  \ There is a focus on doctoral\u2013level analysis of scholarship on key concepts\
  \ such as complexity, uncertainty, fragility, and robustness, as well as a critical\
  \ look at the historical roots of the field and related areas such as systems engineering,\
  \ systems dynamics, agent modeling, and systems simulations. Contextual applications\
  \ of the course range from aerospace to technology implementation to regulatory\
  \ systems to large\u2013scale systems change. Special attention is given to the\
  \ interdependence of social and technical dimensions of engineering systems.\n"
