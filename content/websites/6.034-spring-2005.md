course_description: 'This course introduces representations, techniques, and architectures
  used to build applied systems and to account for intelligence from a computational
  point of view. This course also explores applications of rule chaining, heuristic
  search, logic, constraint propagation, constrained search, and other problem-solving
  paradigms. In addition, it covers applications of decision trees, neural nets, SVMs
  and other learning paradigms.
