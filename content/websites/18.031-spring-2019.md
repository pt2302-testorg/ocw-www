course_description: "This half-semester course studies basic continuous control theory\
  \ as well as representation of functions in the complex frequency domain. It covers\
  \ generalized functions, unit impulse response, and convolution. Also covered are\
  \ the Laplace transform, system (or transfer) functions, and the pole diagram. Examples\
  \ from mechanical and electrical engineering are provided.\n\nGo to [OCW\u2019s\
  \ Open Learning Library site for _18.031: System Functions and the Laplace Transform_](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+18.031+2019_Spring/about).\
  \ The site is free to use, just like all OCW sites. You have the option to sign\
  \ up and enroll in the course if you want to track your progress, or you can view\
  \ and use all the materials without enrolling.\n"
