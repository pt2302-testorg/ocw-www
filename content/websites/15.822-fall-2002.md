course_description: 'Marketing research may be divided into methods that emphasize
  understanding "the customer" and methods that emphasize understanding "the market."
  This course (15.822) deals with the market. The companion course (15.821) deals
  with the customer.


  The course will teach you how to write, conduct and analyze a marketing research
  survey. The emphasis will be on discovering market structure and segmentation, but
  you can pursue other project applications.


  A major objective of the course is to give you some "hands-on" exposure to analysis
  techniques that are widely used in consulting and marketing research factor analysis,
  perceptual mapping, conjoint, and cluster analysis). These techniques used to be
  considered advanced but now involve just a few keystrokes on most stat software
  packages.


  The course assumes familiarity with basic probability, statistics, and multiple
  linear regression.
