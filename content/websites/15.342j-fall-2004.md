course_description: 'The goal of this doctoral course is to familiarize students with
  major conceptual frameworks, debates, and developments in contemporary organization
  theory. This is an inter-disciplinary domain of inquiry drawing primarily from sociology,
  and secondarily from economics, psychology, anthropology, and political science.
  The course focuses on inter-organizational processes, and also addresses the economic,
  institutional and cultural contexts that organizations must face.


  This is an introduction to a vast and multifaceted domain of inquiry. Due to time
  limitations, this course will touch lightly on many important topics, and neglect
  others entirely; its design resembles more a map than an encyclopedia. Also, given
  the focus on theoretical matters, methodological issues will move to the background.
  Empirical material will be used to illustrate how knowledge is produced from a particular
  standpoint and trying to answer particular questions, leaving the bulk of the discussion
  on quantitative and qualitative procedures to seminars such as 15.347, 15.348, and
  the like.
