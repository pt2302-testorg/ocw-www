course_description: 'This course is an advanced treatment of biochemical mechanisms
  that underlie biological processes. Topics include macromolecular machines such
  as the ribosome, the proteasome, fatty acid synthases as a paradigm for polyketide
  synthases and non-ribosomal polypeptide synthases, and polymerases. Emphasis will
  be given to the experimental methods used to unravel how these processes fit into
  the cellular context as well as the coordinated regulation of these processes.
