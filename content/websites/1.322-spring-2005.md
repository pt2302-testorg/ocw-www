course_description: 'This class presents a detailed study of soil properties with
  emphasis on interpretation of field and laboratory test data and their use in soft-ground
  construction engineering. Topics to be covered include: consolidation and secondary
  compression; basic strength principles; stress-strain strength behavior of clays,
  emphasizing effects of sample disturbance, anisotropy, and strain rate; strength
  and compression of granular soils; and engineering properties of compacted soils.
  Some knowledge of field and laboratory testing is assumed for all students.
