course_description: 'This subject is the first semester of four that forms an introduction
  to modern standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin, the language with the largest
  number of native speakers in the world. It is the official language of Mainland
  China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. The course presupposes
  no prior background in the language. Course objectives are to master Mandarin pronunciation,
  including the recognition and writing of Pinyin romanization, basic reading and
  writing skills (around 150 characters in the traditional character set or the simplified
  set), and to develop the ability to participate in simple, practical conversations
  on everyday topics. The relationship between Chinese language and culture and the
  sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Typical
  class format will include performance of memorized basic conversations, drills,
  questions and discussion, and various types of communicative exercises.
