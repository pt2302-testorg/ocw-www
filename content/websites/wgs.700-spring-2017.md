course_description: "In this course, students will develop their abilities to expose\
  \ ways that scientific knowledge has been shaped in contexts that are gendered,\
  \ racialized, economically exploitative, and hetero-normative. This happens through\
  \ a sequence of four projects that concern:\n\n1. Interpretation of the cultural\
  \ dimension of sciences\n2. Climate change futures\n3. Genomic citizenry\n4. Students'\
  \ plans for ongoing practice\n\nThe course uses a Project-Based Learning format\
  \ that allows students to shape their own directions of inquiry in each project,\
  \ development of skills, and collegial support. Students' learning will be guided\
  \ by individualized bibliographies co-constructed with the instructors, the inquiries\
  \ of the other students, and a set of tools and processes for literary analysis,\
  \ inquiry, reflection, and support.\_\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nProfessor Peter\
  \ Taylor spent several years crafting the unique structure of the course, which\
  \ is crucial to the way it was taught.\_\n\n**The Consortium for Graduate Studies\
  \ in Gender, Culture, Women, and Sexuality**\n\nThis course was taught as part of\
  \ the [Consortium for Graduate Studies in Gender, Culture, Women, and Sexuality](http://mit.edu/GCWS/index.html)\
  \ (GCWS) at MIT. The GCWS brings together scholars and teachers at nine degree-granting\
  \ institutions in the Boston area who are devoted to graduate teaching and research\
  \ in Women's Studies and to advance interdisciplinary Women's Studies scholarship."
