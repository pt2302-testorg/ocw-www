course_description: 'Aging involves an intrinsic and progressive decline in function
  that eventually will affect us all. While everyone is familiar with aging, many
  basic questions about aging are mysterious. Why are older people more likely to
  experience diseases like cancer, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders? What changes
  happen at the molecular and cellular levels to cause the changes that we associate
  with old age? Is aging itself a disease, and can we successfully intervene in the
  aging process?


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
