course_description: 'This class brings anthropological concepts to bear on contemporary
  movements for justice for harms committed during European colonization in Africa.
  Over the course of the semester, we use critical readings on topics such as violence,
  human rights discourse, narrating and measuring harm, memory, and group identity
  formation to reflect on and contribute to the work of two groups of practitioners
  currently engaged in claims for justice and reparations for European colonialism
  in Africa: in Algeria (France), and in the Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda respectively
  (Belgium).'
