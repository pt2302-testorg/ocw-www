course_description: "Although this class starts by critically examining the term \u201C\
  ethnic\u201D as it defines a wide range of cultural forms over time, we will focus\
  \ mostly on contemporary writers. Questions to consider will include: How has ethnic\
  \ writing changed American culture and renovated forms of literary expression? What\
  \ are the varieties and nuances of what we might call an ethnic subjectivity? What\
  \ could it mean to harbor fugitives within the self: transgressive thoughts or a\
  \ \u201Cforeign\u201D identity? And what is the future of \u201Cethnic\u201D literature\
  \ in a global space?\n"
