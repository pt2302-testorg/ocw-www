course_description: 'Memory is not a unitary faculty, but rather consists of multiple
  forms of learning that differ in their operating characteristics and neurobiological
  substrates. This seminar will consider current debates regarding the cognitive and
  neural architectures of memory, specifically focusing on recent efforts to address
  these controversies through application of functional neuroimaging (primarily fMRI
  and PET).
