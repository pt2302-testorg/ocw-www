course_description: "This six-week summer course teaches basic concepts of corporate\
  \ financial accounting and reporting. This information is widely used in making\
  \ investment decisions, corporate and managerial performance assessment, and valuation\
  \ of firms.\_Students perform economics-based analysis of accounting information\
  \ from the viewpoint of the users of accounting information (especially senior managers)\
  \ rather than the preparer (the accountant). This course is restricted to MIT Sloan\
  \ Fellows in Innovation and Global Leadership.\n"
