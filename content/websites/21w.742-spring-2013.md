course_description: "Does race still matter, as Cornel West proclaimed in his 1994\
  \ book of that title, or do we now live, as others maintain, in a post-racial society?\
  \ The very notion of what constitutes race remains a complex and evolving question\
  \ in cultural terms. In this course we will engage this question head-on, reading\
  \ and writing about issues involving the construction of race and racial identity\
  \ as reflected from a number of vantage points and via a rich array of voices and\
  \ genres. Readings will include literary works by such writers as Toni Morrison,\
  \ Junot Diaz, and Sherman Alexie, as well as perspectives on film and popular culture\
  \ from figures such as Malcolm Gladwell and Tour\xE9.\n"
