course_description: "This three-module sequence of courses covers advanced topics\
  \ in quantum computation and quantum information, including quantum error correction\
  \ code techniques; efficient quantum computation principles, including fault-tolerance;\
  \ and quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. Prior knowledge\
  \ of quantum circuits and elementary quantum algorithms is assumed. These courses\
  \ are the second part in a sequence of two quantum information science subjects\
  \ at MIT.\n\nThe three modules comprise:\n\n[8.371.1x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/about):\
  \ Quantum states, noise and error correction\_\_  \n[8.371.2x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.2x+1T2018/about):\
  \ Efficient quantum computing\u2014fault tolerance and algorithms\_\_  \n[8.371.3x:](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.3x+2T2018/about)\
  \ Quantum complexity theory and information theory\n\nThis course was organized\
  \ as a three-part series on [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx) by MIT\u2019\
  s Department of Physics and is now archived on the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each module\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling."
