course_description: 'Everything around us is made from different chemical elements:
  carbon, silicon, iron, and all the other elements from the Periodic Table. The lighter
  elements were mostly produced in the Big Bang, but the rest were (and are) formed
  within stars and in the explosions of supernovae. In this series of short lecture
  videos, created to accompany her book _Searching for the Oldest Stars: Ancient Relics
  from the Early Universe_ (Princeton University Press, 2019), Professor Anna Frebel
  reveals the secrets of stardust and explains the cosmic origin of the elements.
