course_description: 'This subject provides an introduction to modeling and simulation,
  covering continuum methods, atomistic and molecular simulation, and quantum mechanics.
  Hands-on training is provided in the fundamentals and applications of these methods
  to key engineering problems. The lectures provide exposure to areas of application
  based on the scientific exploitation of the power of computation. We use web based
  applets for simulations, thus extensive programming skills are not required.
