course_description: 'This course offers an introduction to the interdisciplinary study
  of videogames as texts through an examination of their cultural, educational, and
  social functions in contemporary settings. Students play and analyze videogames
  while reading current research and theory from a variety of sources in the sciences,
  social sciences, humanities, and industry. Assignments focus on game analysis in
  the context of the theories discussed in class. Class meetings involve regular reading,
  writing, and presentation exercises. No prior programming experience required. Students
  taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.
