course_description: 'This course will introduce you to the Western philosophical tradition,
  through the study of major figures such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, and
  Kant. You will get to grips with questions that have been significant to philosophy
  from its beginnings: questions about the nature of the mind or soul, the existence
  of God, the foundations of knowledge, ethics and the good life. In the process of
  evaluating the arguments of these philosophers, you will develop your own philosophical
  and analytical skills. You will also observe changes of intellectual outlook over
  time, and the effect of scientific, religious and political concerns on the development
  of philosophical ideas.


  Lecture handouts will be supplied for Lec #1-8, and #16-25. For the section on Descartes''
  Meditations, Lec #9-15, my separate _Study Guide to Descartes'' Meditations_ is
  available in the [study materials](/courses/24-01-classics-in-western-philosophy-spring-2006/pages/study-materials)
  section.
