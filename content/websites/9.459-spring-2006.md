course_description: 'What are the circuits, mechanisms and representations that permit
  the recognition of a visual scene from just one glance? In this one-day seminar
  on Scene Understanding, speakers from a variety of disciplines - neurophysiology,
  cognitive neuroscience, visual cognition, computational neuroscience and computer
  vision - will address a range of topics related to scene recognition, including
  natural image categorization, contextual effects on object recognition, and the
  role of attention in scene understanding and visual art. The goal is to encourage
  exchanges between researchers of all fields of brain sciences in the burgeoning
  field of scene understanding.
