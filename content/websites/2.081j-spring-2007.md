course_description: 'This course explores the following topics: derivation of elastic
  and plastic stress-strain relations for plate and shell elements; the bending and
  buckling of rectangular plates; nonlinear geometric effects; post-buckling and ultimate
  strength of cold formed sections and typical stiffened panels used in naval architecture;
  the general theory of elastic shells and axisymmetric shells; buckling, crushing
  and bending strength of cylindrical shells with application to offshore structures;
  and the application to crashworthiness of vehicles and explosive and impact loading
  of structures. The class is taught during the first half of term.
