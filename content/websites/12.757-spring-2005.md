course_description: 'This seminar is intended to help students in the MIT/Woods Hole
  Oceanographic Institution Joint Program develop a broader perspective on their thesis
  research by considering some aspects of science in the large. The first part of
  the course challenges students to develop a thoughtful view towards major questions
  in science that can be incorporated in their own research process, and that will
  help them articulate research findings. The second part of the course emphasizes
  science as a social process and the important roles of written and oral communication.


  This course is offered through The [MIT/WHOI Joint Program](http://web.mit.edu/mit-whoi/www/).
  The MIT/WHOI Joint Program is one of the premier marine science graduate programs
  in the world. It draws on the complementary strengths and approaches of two great
  institutions: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole
  Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).
