course_description: "This class examines the ways humans experience the realm of sound\
  \ and how perceptions and technologies of sound emerge from cultural, economic,\
  \ and historical worlds. In addition to learning about how environmental, linguistic,\
  \ and musical sounds are construed cross-culturally, students learn about the rise\
  \ of telephony, architectural acoustics, and sound recording, as well as about the\
  \ globalized travel of these technologies. Questions of ownership, property, authorship,\
  \ and copyright in the age of digital file sharing are also addressed. A major concern\
  \ will be with how the sound/noise boundary has been imagined, created, and modeled\
  \ across diverse sociocultural and scientific contexts. Auditory examples \u2014\
  \ sound art, environmental recordings, music \u2014 will be provided and invited\
  \ throughout the term.\n"
