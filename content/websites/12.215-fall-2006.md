course_description: 'This course introduces the concepts and applications of navigation
  techniques using celestial bodies and satellite positioning systems such as the
  Global Positioning System (GPS). Topics include astronomical observations, radio
  navigation systems, the relationship between conventional navigation results and
  those obtained from GPS, and the effects of the security systems, Selective Availability,
  and anti-spoofing on GPS results. Laboratory sessions cover the use of sextants,
  astronomical telescopes, and field use of GPS. Application areas covered include
  ship, automobile, and aircraft navigation and positioning, including very precise
  positioning applications.
