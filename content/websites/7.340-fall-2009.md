course_description: 'The mammalian brain easily outperforms any computer. It adapts
  and changes constantly. Most importantly, the brain enables us to continuously learn
  and remember. What are the molecular mechanisms that lead to learning and memory?
  What are the cellular roles that activity-regulated gene products play to implement
  changes in the brain?


  How do nerve cells, their connections (synapses), and brain circuits change over
  time to store information? We will discuss the molecular mechanisms of neuronal
  plasticity at the synaptic, cellular and circuit levels, especially


  *   synapse formation,

  *   synaptic growth and stabilization,

  *   synaptic transmission,

  *   axonal and dendritic outgrowth, and

  *   circuit formation


  We will learn about the roles of some activity-regulated genes as well as the tools
  and techniques employed in modern neuroscience. Our goal will be to understand molecular
  mechanisms the brain employs to accomplish learning and memory.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
