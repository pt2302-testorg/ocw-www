course_description: 'This course examines how people learn, practice, and evaluate
  traditional and contemporary craft techniques. Social science theories of design,
  embodiment, apprenticeship learning, skill, labor, expertise, and tacit knowledge
  are used to explore distinctions and connections among art, craft, and science.
  We will also discuss the commoditization of craft into market goods, collectible
  art, and tourism industries. Ethnographic and historical case studies include textiles,
  glassblowing, quilting, cheese making, industrial design, home cooking, factory
  and laboratory work, CAD-CAM. In-class demonstrations and hands-on craft projects
  will be included.
