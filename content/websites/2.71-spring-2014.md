course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to optical science with
  elementary engineering applications. Topics covered in geometrical optics include:
  ray-tracing, aberrations, lens design, apertures and stops, radiometry and photometry.
  Topics covered in wave optics include: basic electrodynamics, polarization, interference,
  wave-guiding, Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction, image formation, resolution, space-bandwidth
  product. Analytical and numerical tools used in optical design are emphasized. Graduate
  students are required to complete assignments with stronger analytical content,
  and an advanced design project.
