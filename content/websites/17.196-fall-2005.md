course_description: 'This seminar explores changes in the international economy and
  their effects on domestic politics, economy, and society. Is globalization really
  a new phenomenon? Is it irreversible? What are effects on wages and inequality,
  on social safety nets, on production, and innovation? How does it affect relations
  between developed countries and developing countries? How globalization affects
  democracy? These are some of the key issues that will be examined.
