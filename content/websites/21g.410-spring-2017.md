course_description: 'This course exposes students to current issues and language use
  in German technology, business, and international industrial relations, and discusses
  ramifications of these issues in a larger social and cultural context. We seek to
  prepare students who wish to work or study in a German-speaking country by focusing
  on specialized vocabulary and systematic training in speaking and writing skills
  to improve fluency and style and emphasizing communicative strategies that are crucial
  in a working environment. Discussion and analysis of newspaper and magazine articles,
  modern expository prose, and extensive use of online material are included. Taught
  in German.
