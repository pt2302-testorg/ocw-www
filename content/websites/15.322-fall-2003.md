  \ the human processes underlying organizational behavior and change. The class makes\
  \ students aware of the challenge of organizational change and equips them to better\

  \ aim is to increase the students' understanding of these forces \u2013 in themselves\
  \ and in others\_\u2013 so they become more visible and manageable. The prerequisite\
  \ for this course is _15.321 Leading Organizations I_."
