course_description: This resource is a collection of videos taught using a LightBoard,
  a specialized glass that creates a transparent white board. It teaches scientific
  principles to quantitatively assess the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19
  in indoor spaces based on factors such as the occupancy, time, room geometry, mask
  use, ventilation, air filtration, humidity, respiratory activities, etc., as well
  as how these factors interact. This collection is suitable for learners with some
  undergraduate-level training in STEM, although some videos may also be accessible
  to the general public. Graduate students and professionals can watch optional videos
  with more challenging mathematics. A full MITx course with problems and bonus content
  is available for free on [MITx Online](https://courses.mitxonline.mit.edu/learn/course/course-v1:MITxT+10.S95x+3T2022/home).
