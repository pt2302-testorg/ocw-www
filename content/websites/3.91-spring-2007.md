course_description: 'This course is aimed at presenting the concepts underlying the
  response of polymeric materials to applied loads. These will include both the molecular
  mechanisms involved and the mathematical description of the relevant continuum mechanics.
  It is dominantly an "engineering" subject, but with an atomistic flavor. It covers
  the influence of processing and structure on mechanical properties of synthetic
  and natural polymers: Hookean and entropic elastic deformation, linear viscoelasticity,
  composite materials and laminates, yield and fracture.
