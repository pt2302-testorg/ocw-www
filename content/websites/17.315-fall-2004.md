course_description: 'This course examines in comparative prospective the health care
  policy problems facing the United States including providing adequate access to
  medical services for all, the control of rising health care costs, and the assurance
  that the quality of health care services is high and improving. It explores the
  market and regulatory policy options being debated politically in the United States
  to solve these problems and compares possible foreign models for reform including
  those offered by the Canadian, British, Japanese, and German systems. The course
  shows how the historical development of the American health care system limits greatly
  policy options that can be considered and creates pressures that favor a continuing
  emphasis on technology and structural decentralization. The course also examines
  important health risks and the political and organizational factors that distort
  the public''s understanding of these risks.
