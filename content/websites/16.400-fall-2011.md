course_description: 'This course is designed to provide both undergraduate and graduate
  students with a fundamental understanding of human factors that must be taken into
  account in the design and engineering of complex aviation and space systems. The
  primary focus is the derivation of human engineering design criteria from sensory,
  motor, and cognitive sources to include principles of displays, controls and ergonomics,
  manual control, the nature of human error, basic experimental design, and human-computer
  interaction in supervisory control settings. Undergraduate students will demonstrate
  proficiency through aviation accident case presentations, quizzes, homework assignments,
  and hands-on projects. Graduate students will complete all the undergraduate assignments;
  however, they are expected to complete a research-oriented project with a final
  written report and an oral presentation.
