course_description: 'This research-oriented course will focus on algebraic and computational
  techniques for optimization problems involving polynomial equations and inequalities
  with particular emphasis on the connections with semidefinite optimization. The
  course will develop in a parallel fashion several algebraic and numerical approaches
  to polynomial systems, with a view towards methods that simultaneously incorporate
  both elements. We will study both the complex and real cases, developing techniques
  of general applicability, and stressing convexity-based ideas, complexity results,
  and efficient implementations. Although we will use examples from several engineering
  areas, particular emphasis will be given to those arising from systems and control
  applications.
