course_description: 'This course is the third and final part of our graduate introduction
  to semantics. The other two classes are _24.970 Introduction to Semantics_ and _24.973
  Advanced Semantics_. The semester will be divided into somewhat independent units.
  One unit will be devoted to conversational implicatures (mainly scalar implicatures)
  and another to presupposition. In each unit, we will discuss basic concepts and
  technical tools and then devote some time to recent work which illustrates their
  application.
