course_description: 'This is a course on the fundamentals of probability geared towards
  first or second-year graduate students who are interested in a rigorous development
  of the subject. The course covers sample space, random variables, expectations,
  transforms, Bernoulli and Poisson processes, finite Markov chains, and limit theorems.
  There is also a number of additional topics such as: language, terminology, and
  key results from measure theory; interchange of limits and expectations; multivariate
  Gaussian distributions; and deeper understanding of conditional distributions and
  expectations.'
