course_description: 'This course is the continuation of [21G.105](/courses/21g-105-chinese-v-regular-chinese-cultures-society-fall-2003/).
  It is designed to further help students develop sophisticated conversational, reading
  and writing skills by combining traditional textbook material with their own explorations
  of Chinese speaking societies, using the human, literary, and electronic resources
  available at MIT and in the Boston area. Some special features of Chinese society,
  its culture, its customs and habits, its history, and the psychology of its people
  are introduced. The class consists of reading, discussion, composition, network
  exploration, and conversational practice. The course is conducted in Mandarin.
