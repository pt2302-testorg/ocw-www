course_description: "This course is an introduction to writing prose for a public\
  \ audience\u2014specifically, prose that is both critical and personal, that features\
  \ your ideas, your perspective, and your voice to engage readers. The focus of our\
  \ reading and your writing will be American popular culture, broadly defined. That\
  \ is, you will write **essays** that critically engage elements and aspects of contemporary\
  \ American popular culture and that do so via a vivid personal voice and presence.\
  \ In the coming weeks we will read a number of pieces that address current issues\
  \ in popular culture. These readings will address a great many subjects from the\
  \ contemporary world to launch and elaborate an argument or position or refined\
  \ observation. And you yourselves will write a great deal, attending always to the\
  \ ways your purpose in writing and your intended audience shape what and how you\
  \ write. The end result of our collaborative work will be a new edition, the seventh,\
  \ of _Culture Shock!_, an online magazine of writings on American popular culture,\
  \ which we will post on the Web for the worldwide reading public to enjoy.\n"
