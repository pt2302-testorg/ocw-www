course_description: 'This course is an introduction to the theory that tries to explain
  how minds are made from collections of simpler processes. It treats such aspects
  of thinking as vision, language, learning, reasoning, memory, consciousness, ideals,
  emotions, and personality. It incorporates ideas from psychology, artificial intelligence,
  and computer science to resolve theoretical issues such as wholes vs. parts, structural
  vs. functional descriptions, declarative vs. procedural representations, symbolic
  vs. connectionist models, and logical vs. common-sense theories of learning.
