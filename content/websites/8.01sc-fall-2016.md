course_description: "This first course in the physics curriculum introduces classical\
  \ mechanics. Historically, a set of core concepts\u2014space, time, mass, force,\
  \ momentum, torque, and angular momentum\u2014were introduced in classical mechanics\
  \ in order to solve the most famous physics problem, the motion of the planets.\n\
  \nThe principles of mechanics successfully described many other phenomena encountered\
  \ in the world. Conservation laws involving energy, momentum and angular momentum\
  \ provided a second parallel approach to solving many of the same problems. In this\
  \ course, we will investigate both approaches: Force and conservation laws.\n\n\
  Our goal is to develop a conceptual understanding of the core concepts, a familiarity\
  \ with the experimental verification of our theoretical laws, and an ability to\
  \ apply the theoretical framework to describe and predict the motions of bodies."
