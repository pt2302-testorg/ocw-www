course_description: 'What is a "life" when it''s written down? How does memory inform
  the present? Why are autobiographies and memoirs so popular? This course will address
  these questions among others, considering the relationship between biography, autobiography,
  and memoir and between personal and social themes. We will examine classic authors
  such as Mary Rowlandson, Benjamin Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs,
  and Mark Twain; then more recent examples like Tobias Wolff, Art Spiegelman, Sherman
  Alexie, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, Edwidge Danticat, and Alison Bechdel.
