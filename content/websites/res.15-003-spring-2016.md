course_description: 'The goal of this course is to explore and develop plans of action
  for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow''s workforce.
  If we take the right actions we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the
  needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so we first
  have to understand how the world of work is changing, how firms can compete and
  prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies and practices
  governing the world of work.
