course_description: 'This course clarifies key marketing concepts, methods, and strategic
  issues relevant for start-up and early-stage entrepreneurs. At this course, there
  are two major questions:


  1.  **Marketing Question:** What and how am I selling to whom?

  2.  **New Venture Question:** How do I best leverage my limited marketing recourses?


  Specifically, this course is designed to give students a broad and deep understanding
  of such topics as:


  1.  What are major strategic constraints and issues confronted by entrepreneurs
  today?

  2.  How can one identify and evaluate marketing opportunities?

  3.  How do entrepreneurs achieve competitive advantages given limited marketing
  resources?

  4.  What major marketing/sales tools are most useful in an entrepreneurial setting?


  Because there is no universal marketing solution applicable to all entrepreneurial
  ventures, this course is designed to help students develop a flexible way of thinking
  about marketing problems in general.
