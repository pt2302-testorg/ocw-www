course_description: 'This course focuses on the land use-transportation "interaction
  space" in metropolitan settings. The course aims to develop an understanding of
  relevant theories and analytical techniques, through the exploration of various
  cases drawn from different parts of the world. The course begins with an overview
  of the role of transportation in patterns of urban development and metropolitan
  growth. It introduces the concept of accessibility and related issues of individual
  and firm travel demand. Later in the semester, students will explore the influence
  of the metropolitan built environment on travel behavior and the role of transportation
  on metropolitan land development. The course will conclude with an examination of
  the implications of the land use-transportation interaction space for metropolitan
  futures, and our abilities to forecast them.
