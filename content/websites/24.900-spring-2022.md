course_description: This class provides some answers to basic questions about the
  nature of human language. Throughout the course, we examine a number of ways in
  which human language is a complex but law-governed mental system. Much of the class
  is devoted to studying some core aspects of this system in detail; we also spend
  individual classes discussing a number of other issues, including how language is
  acquired, how languages change over time, language endangerment, and others.
