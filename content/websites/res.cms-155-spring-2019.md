  as successful as possible? If future jobs require creativity, problem-solving, and
  communication, how do we teach these skills in meaningful ways? How do we bring
  together passionate school leaders to create systemic solutions to educational challenges?

  with real-world education examples, as well as opportunities for learners to apply
  concepts in their own setting.
