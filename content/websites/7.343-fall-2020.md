course_description: "The natural world is a mega-factory of small molecules, peptides,\
  \ fatty acids, phospholipids, and a host of other compounds, known as natural products\
  \ (NPs). Immensely diverse in structure and function, NPs have strongly influenced\
  \ how we treat infectious disease, cancer, pain, and a host of other conditions.\
  \ Roughly half of the drugs that have been approved in the past 30 years are NPs,\
  \ derivatives of NPs or NP-inspired. In this discussion-based course, we will delve\
  \ into research on discovering NPs from producing organisms, investigating the biochemistry\
  \ of NP production, and using synthetic biology to create NP derivatives\u2014all\
  \ with a particular emphasis on how genomic data guides and informs all these studies.\n\
  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
