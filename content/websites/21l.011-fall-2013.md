course_description: 'This course concentrates on close analysis and criticism of a
  wide range of films, from the early silent period, classic Hollywood genres including
  musicals, thrillers and westerns, and European and Japanese art cinema. It explores
  the work of Griffith, Chaplin, Keaton, Capra, Hawks, Hitchcock, Altman, Renoir,
  DeSica, and Kurosawa. Through comparative reading of films from different eras and
  countries, students develop the skills to turn their in-depth analyses into interpretations
  and explore theoretical issues related to spectatorship.
