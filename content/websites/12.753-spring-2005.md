course_description: 'In this year''s seminar, we will embark on a scientific journey
  through some of the most controversial topics about the origin and formation of
  our home planet. This journey will take us to other planetary bodies - even to other
  solar systems - as we immerse ourselves in observations and theories from the microscopic
  to the universe scale.


  The seminar will be organized around three broad questions: How was the Earth formed?
  What did early Earth look like? When did living organisms first appear on Earth?


  Experts in meteorites, geology of other planets, thermodynamics and tracers of living
  organisms, and theories of formation and evolution of planets, including early atmosphere
  and oceans, will come to WHOI and help us address these questions.
