course_description: 'This subject is an introduction to poetry as a genre; most of
  our texts are originally written in English. We read poems from the Renaissance
  through the 17th and 18th centuries, Romanticism, and Modernism. Focus will be on
  analytic reading, on literary history, and on the development of the genre and its
  forms; in writing we attend to techniques of persuasion and of honest evidenced
  sequential argumentation. Poets to be read will include William Shakespeare, Queen
  Elizabeth, William Wordsworth, John Keats, T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Sylvia Plath,
  Elizabeth Bishop, and some contemporary writers.
