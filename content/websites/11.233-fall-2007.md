course_description: 'This course develops skills in research design for policy analysis
  and planning. The emphasis is on the logic of the research process and its constituent
  elements. The course relies on a seminar format so students are expected to read
  all of the assigned materials and come to class prepared to discuss key themes,
  ideas, and controversies. Since the materials draw broadly on the social sciences,
  and since students have diverse interests and methodological preferences, ongoing
  themes in our discussions will be linking concepts to planning scholarship in general
  and considering how different epistemological orientations and methodological techniques
  map on to planning specializations.
