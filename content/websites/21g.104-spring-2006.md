course_description: "This is the last of the four courses (Chinese I through IV) that\
  \ make up the foundation level (four semesters over two years in the normal curriculum)\
  \ of MIT's regular (non-streamlined) Chinese program. Chinese IV is designed to\
  \ consolidate conversational usage and grammatical and cultural knowledge encountered\
  \ in the earlier courses, and to expand reading and listening abilities. It integrates\
  \ the last part of _Learning Chinese_ (two units designed primarily for review of\
  \ grammatical concepts and vocabulary growth) with material from Madeline Spring's\
  \ _Making Connections_, designed to bolster listening skills, and Linda Hsai and\
  \ Roger Yue's _Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio_, a collection of traditional\
  \ stories that has been a favorite of students of Chinese for many decades and is\
  \ used here to focus on reading. Reading for this course is primarily, but not exclusively,\
  \ in the simplified character set that is the standard on the Mainland; readings\
  \ in the traditional set that is standard in Taiwan are also assigned.\n\nStudents\
  \ who have advanced through Chinese I, II, and III to reach this level, as well\
  \ as those entering at Chinese IV, should review at least the late material in Chinese\
  \ III before proceeding.\n\nChinese Sequence on OCW\n-----------------------\n\n\
  MIT OpenCourseWare now offers a complete sequence of four Chinese language courses,\
  \ covering beginning to intermediate levels of instruction at MIT. They can be used\
  \ not just as the basis for taught courses, but also for self-instruction and elementary-to-intermediate\
  \ review.\n\nThe four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online\
  \ textbook in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's _Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course\
  \ in Mandarin_; audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in\
  \ this book; and syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term.\n\n{{< tableopen\
