course_description: 'The MIT Biology Department core courses, [7.012](/courses/7-012-introduction-to-biology-fall-2004/),
  7.013, and [7.014](/courses/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/), all cover
  the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry,
  genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. 7.013 focuses on the application
  of the fundamental principles toward an understanding of human biology. Topics include
  genetics, cell biology, molecular biology, disease (infectious agents, inherited
  diseases and cancer), developmental biology, neurobiology and evolution.


  Biological function at the molecular level is particularly emphasized in all courses
  and covers the structure and regulation of genes, as well as, the structure and
  synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated into cells, and how these
  cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms. In addition, each
  version of the subject has its own distinctive material.
