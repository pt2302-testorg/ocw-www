course_description: 'Course 8.022 is one of several second-term freshman physics courses
  offered at MIT. It is geared towards students who are looking for a thorough and
  challenging introduction to electricity and magnetism. Topics covered include: Electric
  and magnetic field and potential; introduction to special relativity; Maxwell''s
  equations, in both differential and integral form; and properties of dielectrics
  and magnetic materials. In addition to the theoretical subject matter, several experiments
  in electricity and magnetism are performed by the students in the laboratory.
