course_description: "This course considers reggae, or Jamaican popular music more\
  \ generally\u2014in its various forms (ska, rocksteady, roots, dancehall)\u2014\
  as constituted by international movements and exchanges and as a product that circulates\
  \ globally in complex ways. By reading across the reggae literature, as well as\
  \ considering reggae texts themselves (songs, films, videos, and images), students\
  \ will scrutinize the different interpretations of reggae's significance and the\
  \ implications of different interpretations of the story of Jamaica and its music.\
  \ Beginning with a consideration of how Jamaica's popular music industry emerged\
  \ out of transnational exchanges, the course will proceed to focus on reggae's circulation\
  \ outside of Jamaica via diasporic networks and commercial mediascapes. Among other\
  \ sites, we will consider reggae's resonance and impact elsewhere in the Anglo Caribbean\
  \ (e.g., Trinidad, Barbados), the United Kingdom (including British reggae styles\
  \ but also such progeny as jungle, grime, and dubstep), the United States (both\
  \ as reggae per se and in hip-hop), Panama and Puerto Rico and other Latin American\
  \ locales (e.g., Brazil), Japan and Australia, as well as West, South, and East\
  \ Africa (C\xF4te d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Uganda).\n"
