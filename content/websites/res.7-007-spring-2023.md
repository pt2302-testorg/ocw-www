course_description: "In this course, you will engage in the biology of cells of higher\
  \ organisms. You will study the structure, function, and biosynthesis of cellular\
  \ membranes and organelles; cell growth and oncogenic transformation; transport,\
  \ receptors, and cell signaling; the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, and\
  \ cell movements; cell division and cell cycle; functions of specialized cell types.\
  \ This course emphasizes the current molecular knowledge of cell biological processes\
  \ as well as the genetic, biochemical, and other experimental approaches that resulted\
  \ in these discoveries.\n\nThis course, based on the MIT course *7.06 Cell Biology*\
  \ taken by enrolled MIT students, was organized as a three-part series on [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx)\
  \ by [MIT\u2019s Department of Biology](https://biology.mit.edu/). It is [self-paced\
  \ and free](https://web.mit.edu/mitxbio/courses.html) as long as you enroll in the\
  \ Audit Track option, which you can select after creating a free account on edX."
