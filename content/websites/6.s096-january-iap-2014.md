course_description: 'This course is a fast-paced introduction to the C and C++ programming
  languages, with an emphasis on good programming practices and how to be an effective
  programmer in these languages. Topics include object-oriented programming, memory
  management, advantages of C and C++, optimization, and others. Students are given
  weekly coding assignments and a final project to hone their skills. Recommended
  for programmers with some background and experience in other languages.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
