course_description: 'The course will start with an overview of the central and peripheral
  nervous systems (CNS and PNS), the development of their structure and major divisions.
  The major functional components of the CNS will then be reviewed individually. Topography,
  functional distribution of nerve cell bodies, ascending and descending tracts in
  the spinal cord. Brainstem organization and functional components, including cranial
  nerve nuclei, ascending / descending pathways, amine-containing cells, structure
  and information flow in the cerebellar and vestibular systems. Distribution of the
  cranial nerves, resolution of their skeletal and branchial arch components. Functional
  divisions of the Diencephalon and Telencephalon. The course will then continue with
  how these various CNS pieces and parts work together. Motor systems, motor neurons
  and motor units, medial and lateral pathways, cortical versus cerebellar systems
  and their functional integration. The sensory systems, visual, auditory and somatosensory.
  Olfaction will be covered in the context of the limbic system, which will also include
  autonomic control and the Papez circuit. To conclude, functional organization and
  information flow in the neocortex will be discussed.
