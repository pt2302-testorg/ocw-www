course_description: "Urban governance comprises the various forces, institutions,\
  \ and movements that guide economic and physical development, the distribution of\
  \ resources, social interactions, and other aspects of daily life in urban areas.\
  \ This course examines governance from legal, political, social, and economic perspectives.\
  \ In addition, we will discuss how these structures constrain collective decision\
  \ making about particular urban issues (immigration, education\u2026). Assignments\
  \ will be nightly readings and a short paper relating an urban issue to the frameworks\
  \ outlined in the class.\n"
