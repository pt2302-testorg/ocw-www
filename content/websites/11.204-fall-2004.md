course_description: "This course focuses on methods of digital visualization and communication\
  \ and their application to planning issues. Lectures will introduce a variety of\
  \ methods for describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating\
  \ changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple actors\
  \ in the process of guiding action. Through a series of laboratory exercises, students\
  \ will apply these methods in the construction of a web-based portfolio. The portfolio\
  \ is not only the final project for the course, but will serve as a container for\
  \ other course work throughout the MCP program.\n\nThis course aims to introduce\
  \ students to (1) such persistent and recurring themes as place, race, power and\
  \ the environment that face planners, (2) the role of digital technologies in representing,\
  \ analyzing, and mobilizing communities, (3) MIT faculty and their work, (4) MIT's\
  \ computing environment and resources including Athena, Element K, the ESRI virtual\
  \ campus, Computer Resources Laboratory (CRL), Campus Wide Information Systems Support\
  \ (CWIS), the GIS Laboratory at Rotch Library and (5) software tools like Adobe\xAE\
  \ Photoshop\xAE and Illustrator\xAE, ESRI ArcView, Microsoft\xAE Access, and Macromedia\xAE\
  \ Dreamweaver\xAE that will assist them in creating digital images, working with\
  \ relational databases, and launching a web-based portfolio.\n"
