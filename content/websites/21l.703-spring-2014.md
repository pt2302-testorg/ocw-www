course_description: "Taking as its starting point the works of one of Britain's most\
  \ respected, prolific\u2014and funny\u2014living dramatists, this seminar will explore\
  \ a wide range of knowledge in fields such as math, philosophy, politics, history\
  \ and art. The careful reading and discussion of plays by (Sir) Tom Stoppard and\
  \ some of his most compelling contemporaries (including Caryl Churchill, Anna Deveare\
  \ Smith and Howard Barker) will allow us to time-travel and explore other cultures,\
  \ and to think about the medium of drama as well as one writer's work in depth.\
  \ Some seminar participants will report on earlier plays that influenced these writers,\
  \ others will research everything from Lord Byron's poetry to the bridges of Konigsberg,\
  \ from Dadaism to Charter 77. Employing a variety of critical approaches (both theoretical\
  \ and theatrical), we will consider what postmodernity means, as applied to these\
  \ plays. In the process, we will analyze how drama connects with both the culture\
  \ it represents and that which it addresses in performance. We will also explore\
  \ the wit and verbal energy of these contemporary dramatists\u2026not to mention,\
  \ how Fermat's theorem, classical translation, and chaos theory become the stuff\
  \ of stage comedy.\n"
