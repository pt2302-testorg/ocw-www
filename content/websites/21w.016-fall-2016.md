course_description: "This course takes rhetoric as a system for designing meaning\
  \ that helps us understand complex situations and ideas, enlighten and persuade\
  \ others to act, and thus reshape our world. We\u2019ll study rhetoric systematically\
  \ and empirically, both analyzing how it works on us as readers, and testing how\
  \ we can make informed rhetorical choices as we design our own texts.\n"
