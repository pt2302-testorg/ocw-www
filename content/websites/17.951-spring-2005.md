course_description: 'This course will explore the organization and functions of the
  U.S. Intelligence Community, its interaction with national security policymakers,
  key issues about its workings, and the challenges it faces in defining its future
  role. The events of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq have focused new attention on
  national intelligence, including the most significant reorganization of the community
  since the National Security Act of 1947. The course will highlight some of the major
  debates about the role, practices, and problems of national intelligence.
