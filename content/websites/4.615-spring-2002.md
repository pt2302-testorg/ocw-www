course_description: "Cairo is the quintessential Islamic city. Founded in 634 at the\
  \ strategic head of the Nile Delta, the city evolved from an Islamic military outpost\
  \ to the seat of the ambitious Fatimid caliphate which flourished between the 10th\
  \ and 12th century. Its most spectacular age, however, was the Mamluk period (1250-1517),\
  \ when it became the uncontested center of a resurgent Islam and acquired an architectural\
  \ character that symbolized the image of the Islamic city for centuries to come.\n\
  \nCairo today still shines as a cultural and political center in its three spheres\
  \ of influence: the Arab world, Africa, and the Islamic world. Moreover, many of\
  \ its monuments (456 registered by the 1951 Survey of the Islamic Monuments of Cairo)\
  \ still stand, although they remain largely unknown to the world\u2019s architectural\
  \ community and their numbers are dwindling at an exceedingly alarming pace.\n"
