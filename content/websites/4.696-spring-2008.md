course_description: 'This course will study the question of Global Architecture from
  the point of view of producing a set of lectures on that subject. The course will
  be run in the form of a writing seminar, except that students will be asked to prepare
  for the final class an hour-long lecture for an undergraduate survey course. During
  the semester, students will study the debates about where to locate "the global"
  and do some comparative analysis of various textbooks. The topic of the final lecture
  will be worked on during the semester. For that lecture, students will be asked
  to identify the themes of the survey course, and hand in the bibliography and reading
  list for their lecture.
