course_description: "\"Reading Poetry\" has several aims: primarily, to increase the\
  \ ways you can become more engaged and curious readers of poetry; to increase your\
  \ confidence as writers thinking about literary texts; and to provide you with the\
  \ language for literary description. The course is not designed as a historical\
  \ survey course but rather as an introductory approach to poetry from various directions\
  \ \u2013 as public or private utterances; as arranged imaginative shapes; and as\
  \ psychological worlds, for example. One perspective offered is that poetry offers\
  \ intellectual, moral and linguistic pleasures as well as difficulties to our private\
  \ lives as readers and to our public lives as writers. Expect to hear and read poems\
  \ aloud and to memorize lines; the class format will be group discussion, occasional\
  \ lecture.\n"
