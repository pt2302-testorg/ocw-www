course_description: 'This course draws on a wide range of perspectives to explore
  the roots of long term competitive advantage in unusually successful firms. Using
  a combination of cases, simulations, readings and, most importantly, lively discussion,
  the course will explore the ways in which long term advantage is built from first
  mover advantage, increasing returns, and unique organizational competencies. We
  will focus particularly on the ways in which the actions of senior management build
  competitive advantage over time, and on the strategic implications of understanding
  the roots of a firm''s success.
