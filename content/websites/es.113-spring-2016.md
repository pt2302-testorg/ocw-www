course_description: 'This course explores the relationship between ancient Greek philosophy
  and mathematics. We investigate how ideas of definition, reason, argument and proof,
  rationality / irrationality, number, quality and quantity, truth, and even the idea
  of an idea were shaped by the interplay of philosophic and mathematical inquiry.
  The course examines how discovery of the incommensurability of magnitudes challenged
  the Greek presumption that the cosmos is fully understandable. Students explore
  the influence of mathematics on ancient Greek ethical theories. We read such authors
  as: Euclid, Plato, Aristotle, Nicomachus, Theon of Smyrna, Bacon, Descartes, Dedekind,
  and Newton.
