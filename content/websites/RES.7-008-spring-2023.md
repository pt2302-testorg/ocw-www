course_description: "This course is an in-depth adventure through the molecular mechanisms\
  \ that control the maintenance, expression, and evolution of prokaryotic and eukaryotic\
  \ genomes. Through lectures and readings of relevant literature, students will explore\
  \ gene regulation, DNA replication, genetic recombination, transcription, and mRNA\
  \ translation. The quizzes are designed to build students' experimental design and\
  \ data analysis skills.\n\nThis course, based on the MIT course *7.28/7.58 Molecular\
  \ Biology* taken by enrolled MIT students, was organized as a three-part series\
  \ on [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx) by [MIT\u2019s Department of Biology](https://biology.mit.edu/).\
  \ It is [self-paced and free](https://web.mit.edu/mitxbio/courses.html) as long\
  \ as you enroll in the Audit Track option, which you can select after creating a\
  \ free account on edX."
