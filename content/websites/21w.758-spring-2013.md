course_description: 'Some argue that genre fiction is only a marketing category, but
  other critics say that different genres meet specific expectations of readers. This
  course examines these different agreements of what the reader wants and what the
  writer provides under the aegis of different genres. We will look at how genres
  are divided into subgenres, and how they are combined into cross-genre work, always
  keeping in mind the Reader-Writer Contact that is at the heart of genre writing.
  We shall also think about the ways in which crossing genres has led to the establishment
  of new genres (steampunk, preternatural romance) and strongly established subgenres
  (historical mystery, urban fantasy).
