course_description: 'This course is a graduate-level introduction to the probabilistic
  method, a fundamental and powerful technique in combinatorics and theoretical computer
  science. The essence of the approach is to show that some combinatorial object exists
  and prove that a certain random construction works with positive probability. The
  course focuses on methodology as well as combinatorial applications.


  This course was previously numbered 18.218.'
