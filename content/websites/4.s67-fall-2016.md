course_description: "This seminar explores \u201Cland\u201D as a genre, theme, and\
  \ medium of art and architecture of the last five decades. Focusing largely on work\
  \ within the boundaries of the United States, the course seeks to understand how\
  \ the use of land in art and architecture is bound into complicated entanglements\
  \ of property and power, the inheritances of non-U.S. traditions, and the violence\
  \ of colonial ambitions. The term \u201Clandscape\u201D is variously deployed in\
  \ the service of a range of political and philosophical positions.\n"
