course_description: "As we read broadly from throughout the vast chronological period\
  \ that is \"Homer to Dante,\" we will pepper our readings of individual ancient\
  \ and medieval texts with broader questions like: what images, themes, and philosophical\
  \ questions recur through the period; are there distinctly \"classical\" or \"medieval\"\
  \ ways of depicting or addressing them; and what do terms like \"Antiquity\" or\
  \ \"the Middle Ages\" even mean? (What are the Middle Ages in the \"middle\" of,\
  \ for example?) Our texts will include adventure tales of travel and self-discovery\
  \ (Homer's _Odyssey_ and Dante's _Inferno_); courtroom dramas of vengeance and reconciliation\
  \ (Aeschylus's _Oresteia_ and the Icelandic _Nj\xE1ls saga_); short poems of love\
  \ and transformation (Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ and the _Lais_ of Marie de France);\
  \ and epics of war, nation-construction, and empire (Homer's _Iliad_, Virgil's _Aeneid_,\
  \ and the Anglo-Saxon _Beowulf_).\n"
