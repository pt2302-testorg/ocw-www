course_description: 'This course explores elements of nuclear physics for engineering
  students. It covers basic properties of the nucleus and nuclear radiations; quantum
  mechanical calculations of deuteron bound-state wave function and energy; n-p scattering
  cross section; transition probability per unit time and barrier transmission probability.
  It also covers binding energy and nuclear stability; interactions of charged particles,
  neutrons, and gamma rays with matter; radioactive decays; and energetics and general
  cross section behavior in nuclear reactions.
