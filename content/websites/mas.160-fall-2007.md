course_description: 'This class teaches the fundamentals of signals and information
  theory with emphasis on modeling audio/visual messages and physiologically derived
  signals, and the human source or recipient. Topics include linear systems, difference
  equations, Z-transforms, sampling and sampling rate conversion, convolution, filtering,
  modulation, Fourier analysis, entropy, noise, and Shannon''s fundamental theorems.
  Additional topics may include data compression, filter design, and feature detection.
  The undergraduate subject MAS.160 meets with the two half-semester graduate subjects
  MAS.510 and MAS.511, but assignments differ.
