course_description: 'In this course, we will investigate popular culture and narrative
  by focusing on the relationship between literary texts and comics. Several questions
  shape the syllabus and provide a framework for approaching the course materials:
  How do familiar aspects of comics trace their origins to literary texts and broader
  cultural concerns? How have classic comics gone on to influence literary fiction?
  In what ways do contemporary graphic narratives bring a new kind of seriousness
  of purpose to comics, blurring what''s left of the boundaries between the highbrow
  and the lowbrow? Readings and materials for the course range from the nineteenth
  century to the present, and include novels, short stories, essays, older and newer
  comics, and some older and newer films. Expectations include diligent reading, active
  participation, occasional discussion leading, and two papers.
