course_description: 7.003 is an experimental biology course. You will spend most of
  your time in the teaching laboratory practicing fundamental techniques in molecular
  biology, genetics, and cell biology, and working with the model organism *Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae* (budding yeast). In addition to learning how to accurately and safely
  perform these techniques, we want to help you understand how and why these techniques
  work and what scientific questions these techniques can address. The goal is for
  you to be able to design your own experiments to perform by the end of the semester.
