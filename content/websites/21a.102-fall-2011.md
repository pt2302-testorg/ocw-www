course_description: 'An introduction to the cross-cultural study of ethnic and national
  identity. We examine the concept of social identity, and consider the ways in which
  gendered, linguistic, religious, and ethno-racial identity components interact.
  We explore the history of nationalism, including the emergence of the idea of the
  nation-state, as well as ethnic conflict, globalization, identity politics, and
  human rights.
