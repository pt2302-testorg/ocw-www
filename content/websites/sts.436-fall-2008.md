course_description: 'This seminar examines the history and legacy of the Cold War
  on American science. It explores scientist''s new political roles after World War
  II, ranging from elite policy makers in the nuclear age to victims of domestic anti
  Communism. It also examines the changing institutions in which the physical sciences
  and social sciences were conducted during the postwar decades, investigating possible
  epistemic effects on forms of knowledge. The subject closes by considering the place
  of science in the post-Cold War era.
