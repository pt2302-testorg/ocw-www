course_description: 'Fantasy is currently one of the most popular genres across every
  platform in fiction. From film to gaming to literature, fantasy tops the charts.
  Why? Why do people who believe in democracy and live with the magic technology appear
  to long for wizards and dragons and the matters of kingship? In this class, we will
  explore this question, and from that base read articles, novels, write exercises
  and stories in this genre.
