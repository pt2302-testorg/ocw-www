course_description: 'This online textbook represents materials that were used in the
  first four semesters (two years) of the Mandarin program at MIT. They eventually
  formed the basis of a print textbook of the same name, published by Yale University
  Press; information and supplemental materials for the Yale edition are available
  at the [companion website](http://yalebooks.com/wheatley). The OCW course materials
  were extensively revised, and at times reordered, before publication, but the general
  principles of the original remain: to provide a comprehensive resource for the foundation
  levels of Chinese language that separates the learning of oral skills from literary
  (the former being transcribed in pinyin, and the latter in characters). This resource
  contains the complete online version of the text and accompanying audio recordings.
