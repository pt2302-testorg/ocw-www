course_description: 'This course examines electric and magnetic quasistatic forms
  of Maxwell''s equations applied to dielectric, conduction, and magnetization boundary
  value problems. Topics covered include: electromagnetic forces, force densities,
  and stress tensors, including magnetization and polarization; thermodynamics of
  electromagnetic fields, equations of motion, and energy conservation; applications
  to synchronous, induction, and commutator machines; sensors and transducers; microelectromechanical
  systems; propagation and stability of electromechanical waves; and charge transport
  phenomena.

  The instructor would like to thank Thomas Larsen and Matthew Pegler for transcribing
  into LaTeX the homework problems, homework solutions, and exam solutions.
