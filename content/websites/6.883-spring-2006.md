  \ to do with the post-pc era of computing. It is a hands-on project course that\
  \ also includes some foundational subjects. Students will program iPAQ handheld\
  \ computers, cell phones (series 60 phones), speech processing, vision, Cricket\
  \ location systems, GPS, and more. Most of the programming will be using Python\xAE\
  , but Python\xAE can be learned and mastered during the course.\n\nThis course was\
  \ also taught as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA) programme as course number\
  \ SMA 5508 (Pervasive Computing).\n"
