course_description: "The User-friendly Classroom video training series was created\
  \ specifically for teaching assistants for whom English is a second language and\
  \ the USA a second culture by A.C. Kemp, a lecturer in [MIT Global Languages](http://mitgsl.mit.edu/).\_\
  \ These videos focus on developing international teaching assistants' strategies\
  \ for successful, student-centered communication in the interactive American classroom.\
  \ These videos demonstrate best practices through authentic examples of successful\
  \ teaching scenarios, interviews with undergraduates and advice from international\
  \ teaching assistants.\n\nThese videos were created for use with the following courses:\n\
  \n[21G.232](/courses/21g-232-advanced-speaking-and-critical-listening-skills-els-spring-2007/)\
  \ / [21G.233](/courses/21g-232-advanced-speaking-and-critical-listening-skills-els-spring-2007/)\
  \ Advanced Speaking and Critical Listening (ELS)\n\n21G.217 / 21G.218 Workshop in\
  \ Strategies for Effective Teaching (ELS)\n\n_\"Special thanks to my mentor, Jane\
  \ Dunphy, for her support and advice with this project.\"_\n\n_\\- A.C. Kemp_"
