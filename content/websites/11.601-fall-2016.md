course_description: "This course focuses on national environmental and energy policy-making;\
  \ environmental ethics; the techniques of environmental analysis; and strategies\
  \ for collaborative environmental decision-making. The primary objective of the\
  \ course is to help students formulate a personal theory of environmental planning\
  \ practice. The course is taught comparatively, with constant references to examples\
  \ from around the world. It is required of all graduate students pursuing an environmental\
  \ policy and planning specialization in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning\
  \ at MIT.\n\nThis course is the first subject in the Environmental Policy and Planning\
  \ sequence. It reviews philosophical debates including growth vs. deep ecology,\
  \ \"command-and-control\" vs. market-oriented approaches to regulation, and the\
  \ importance of expertise vs. indigenous knowledge. Emphasis is placed on environmental\
  \ planning techniques and strategies. Related topics\_include the management of\
  \ sustainability, the politics of ecosystem management, environmental governance\
  \ and the changing role of civil society, ecological economics, integrated\_assessment\
  \ (combining environmental impact assessment (EIA) and risk assessment), joint fact\
  \ finding in science-intensive policy disputes, environmental justice in poor communities\
  \ of\_color, and environmental dispute resolution.\_*Environmental Problem-Solving*\_\
  (Susskind et al., 2017, Anthem Press), a video-enhanced eBook, provides students\
  \ with full access to all the\_assigned readings, faculty commentary on the readings,\
  \ and examples of the best student performance on course assignments in previous\
  \ years."
