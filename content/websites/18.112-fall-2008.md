course_description: 'This is an advanced undergraduate course dealing with calculus
  in one complex variable with geometric emphasis. Since the course Analysis I (18.100B)
  is a prerequisite, topological notions like compactness, connectedness, and related
  properties of continuous functions are taken for granted.


  This course offers biweekly problem sets with solutions, two term tests and a final
  exam, all with solutions.
