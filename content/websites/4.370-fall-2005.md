course_description: '"Parrhesia" was an Athenian right to frank and open speaking,
  the right that, like the First Amendment, demands a "fearless speaker" who must
  challenge political powers with criticism and unsolicited advice. Can designer and
  artist respond today to such a democratic call and demand? Is it possible to do
  so despite the (increasing) restrictions imposed on our liberties today? Can the
  designer or public artist operate as a proactive "parrhesiatic" agent and contribute
  to the protection, development and dissemination of "fearless speaking" in Public
  Space?
