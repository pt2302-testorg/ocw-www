course_description: "This course is designed around analyzing what\u2019s so funny\
  \ and why is it that we laugh when we do. How is comedy characterized on the fictional\
  \ page, the screen, and the stage? And what might the comic teach us about the self\
  \ and culture(s), especially when we come to understand its patterns of transgression\
  \ as confounding social norms through jokes and laughter? Tracking a history of\
  \ comedy, beginning with the first Greek humorists, Aristophanes and Plautus, we\
  \ will traverse genres, periods and cultures to reflect on various types of humor:\
  \ satire, farce, slapstick, love, tragedy, parody, and screwball.\n"
