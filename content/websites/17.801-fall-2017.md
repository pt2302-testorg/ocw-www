course_description: 'This course is designed to provide an introduction to a variety
  of empirical research methods used by political scientists. The primary aims of
  the course are to make you a more sophisticated consumer of diverse empirical research
  and to allow you to conduct advanced independent work in your junior and senior
  years. This is not a course in data analysis. Rather, it is a course on how to approach
  political science research.
