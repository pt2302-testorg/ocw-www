course_description: 'This course is designed to give students an introduction to the
  law-sensitive aspects of Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A). In Module I, we examine the
  legal implications of key roles and deal structures, and walk through some of the
  issues that would typically arise in a simple and friendly transaction. We also
  give a class to the legal issues arising in LBOs and the legal concerns of financial
  sponsors more generally, and another class to employment-related issues, including
  those relating to managers facing unsettled circumstances.


  In Module II, we look at a variety of complications, including those that arise
  in the friendly or unfriendly purchase of a publicly-held company; deals involving
  distressed and hi-tech companies; antitrust concerns; allegations of misconduct
  by management or board members; and deals involving non-U.S. companies.
