course_description: 'In this course, we will explore how animals determine and maintain
  cell fate. We will discuss changes to DNA structure and packaging, special proteins
  (known as "master regulators") with the ability to alter cell fate via transcription,
  cell-cell signaling, and RNA localization.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.'
