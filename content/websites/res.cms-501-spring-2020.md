course_description: 'Communities have always wrestled with the multiple purposes of
  education: to train young people for careers, vocations, and college; to prepare
  them for their roles as citizens; to develop habits of reflective, ethical adults;
  and to create a common experience in a pluralistic society while meeting the needs
  of individual learners. As the world changes and grows more complex, returning to
  these important questions of purpose can help guide schools in their growth and
  strategic change.


  To ensure our schools are effective, we need to routinely reimagine what the high
  school graduate of the future will need to know and be able to do. The artifact
  that communicates these ideas is called a graduate profile. Making explicit the
  capabilities, competencies, knowledge, and attitudes for secondary school graduates,
  and inviting key stakeholders like students and community members to be engaged
  in the process, can help you and your school to focus your vision of success and
  drive school innovation efforts.
