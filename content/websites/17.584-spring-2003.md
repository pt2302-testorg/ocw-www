course_description: 'This course centers on mechanisms of civilian control of the
  military. Relying on the influential texts of Lasswell, Huntington, and Finer, the
  first classes clarify the basic tensions between the military and civilians. A wide-ranging
  series of case studies follows. These cases are chosen to create a field of variation
  that includes states with stable civilian rule, states with stable military influence,
  and states exhibiting fluctuations between military and civilian control. The final
  three weeks of the course are devoted to the broader relationship between military
  and society.
