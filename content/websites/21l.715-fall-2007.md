course_description: 'What is the history of popular reading in the Western world?
  How does widespread access to print relate to distinctions between highbrow and
  lowbrow culture, between good taste and bad judgment, and between men and women
  readers? This course will introduce students to the broad history of popular reading
  and to controversies about taste and gender that have characterized its development.
  Our grounding in historical material will help make sense of our main focus: recent
  developments in the theory and practice of reading, including fan-fiction, Oprah''s
  book club, comics, hypertext, mass-market romance fiction, mega-chain bookstores,
  and reader response theory.
