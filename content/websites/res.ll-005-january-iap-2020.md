course_description: 'This course introduces the Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data
  Model (D4M), a breakthrough in computer programming that combines graph theory,
  linear algebra, and databases to address problems associated with Big Data. Search,
  social media, ad placement, mapping, tracking, spam filtering, fraud detection,
  wireless communication, drug discovery, and bioinformatics all attempt to find items
  of interest in vast quantities of data. This course teaches a signal processing
  approach to these problems by combining linear algebraic graph algorithms, group
  theory, and database design. This approach has been implemented in software. The
  class will begin with a number of practical problems, introduce the appropriate
  theory, and then apply the theory to these problems. Students will apply these ideas
  in the final project of their choosing. The course will contain a number of smaller
  assignments which will prepare the students with appropriate software infrastructure
  for completing their final projects.
