course_description: 'This course considers the process of neurotransmission, especially
  chemicals used in the brain and elsewhere to carry signals from nerve terminals
  to the structures they innervate. We focus on monoamine transmitters (acetylcholine;
  serotonin; dopamine and norepinephrine); we also examine amino acid and peptide
  transmitters and neuromodulators like adenosine. Macromolecules that mediate neurotransmitter
  synthesis, release, inactivation and receptor-mediated actions are discussed, as
  well as factors that regulate their activity and the second-messenger systems and
  ion fluxes that they control. The involvement of particular neurotransmitters in
  human diseases is considered.
