course_description: 'This course aims to introduce students to the rich diversity
  of human culture from antiquity to the early 17th century. In this course, we will
  explore human culture in its myriad expressions, focusing on the study of literary,
  religious and philosophical texts as ways of narrating, symbolizing, and commenting
  on all aspects of human social and material life. We will work comparatively, reading
  texts from various cultures: Mesopotamian, Greek, Judeo-Christian, Chinese, Indian,
  and Muslim. Throughout the semester, we will be asking questions like: How have
  different cultures imagined themselves? What are the rules that they draw up for
  human behavior? How do they represent the role of the individual in society? How
  do they imagine ''universal'' concepts like love, family, duty? How have their writers
  and artists dealt with encounters with other cultures and other civilizations?
