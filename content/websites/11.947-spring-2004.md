course_description: 'This course explores the application of environmental and economic
  development planning, policy and management approaches to urban neighborhood community
  development. Through an applied service learning approach, the course requires students
  to prepare a sustainable development plan for a community-based non-profit organization.
  Through this client-based planning project, students will have the opportunity to
  test how sustainable development concepts and different economic and environmental
  planning approaches can be applied to advance specific community goals within the
  constraints of specific neighborhoods and community organizations.
