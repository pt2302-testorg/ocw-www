course_description: 'In this graduate-level course, we will be covering advanced topics
  in combinatorial optimization. We will start with non-bipartite matchings and cover
  many results extending the fundamental results of matchings, flows and matroids.
  The emphasis is on the derivation of purely combinatorial results, including min-max
  relations, and not so much on the corresponding algorithmic questions of how to
  find such objects. The intended audience consists of Ph.D. students interested in
  optimization, combinatorics, or combinatorial algorithms.
