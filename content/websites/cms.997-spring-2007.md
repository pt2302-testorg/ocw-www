course_description: 'This class will explore the cultural history and media industry
  surrounding the masculine drama of professional wrestling. Beginning with wrestling''s
  roots in sport and carnival, the class examines how new technologies and changes
  in the television industry led to evolution for pro wrestling style and promotion
  and how shifts in wrestling characters demonstrate changes in the depiction of American
  masculinity. The class will move chronologically in an examination of how wrestling
  characters and performances have changed, focusing particularly on the 1950s to
  the present. Students may have previous knowledge of wrestling but are not required
  to, nor are they required to be a fan (although it is certainly not discouraged,
  either).


  Special thanks to the WWE for allowing us to use various materials and for their
  participation and help with the course.
