course_description: "2.26 is a 6-unit Honors-level subject serving as the Mechanical\
  \ Engineering department's sole course in compressible fluid dynamics. The prerequisites\
  \ for this course are undergraduate courses in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and\
  \ heat transfer.\n\nThe goal of this course is to lay out the fundamental concepts\
  \ and results for the compressible flow of gases. Topics to be covered include:\
  \ appropriate conservation laws; propagation of disturbances; isentropic flows;\
  \ normal shock wave relations, oblique shock waves, weak and strong shocks, and\
  \ shock wave structure; compressible flows in ducts with area changes, friction,\
  \ or heat addition; heat transfer to high speed flows; unsteady compressible flows,\
  \ Riemann invariants, and piston and shock tube problems; steady 2D supersonic flow,\
  \ Prandtl-Meyer function;\_and self-similar compressible flows. The emphasis will\
  \ be on physical understanding of the phenomena and basic analytical techniques.\n"
