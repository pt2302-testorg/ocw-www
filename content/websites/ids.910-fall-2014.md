course_description: 'Students work in a seminar environment to enhance their leadership
  capabilities. An initial Leadership Laboratory Outward Bound experience builds trust,
  teamwork and communications. Readings and assignments emphasize the characteristics
  of effective leadership. Distinguished leaders participate in the "Leadership Lunch"
  story-telling series to share their experiences and to provide recommendations.
  Discussions help explore and further probe leadership development. The learning
  experience culminates in a personal leadership plan.
