course_description: "Linguists take it for granted that all languages, including languages\
  \ in the Global South, are worthy of study. Yet some 40% of children in the world\
  \ are prevented from studying in and valorizing their home languages\u2014including\
  \ some of the very languages that linguists study with such fondness. So much research\
  \ in linguistics and the benefits thereof remain inaccessible to the bulk of the\
  \ very speech communities whose languages linguists study. This seminar examines\
  \ efforts by linguists and educators to make their research more inclusive, accessible,\
  \ and hospitable, and to reduce linguistic-discrimination practices in various communities\
  \ world-wide."
