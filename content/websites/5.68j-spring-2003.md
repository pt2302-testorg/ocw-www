course_description: 'This course deals with the experimental and theoretical aspects
  of chemical reaction kinetics, including transition-state theories, molecular beam
  scattering, classical techniques, quantum and statistical mechanical estimation
  of rate constants, pressure-dependence and chemical activation, modeling complex
  reacting mixtures, and uncertainty/sensitivity analyses. Reactions in the gas phase,
  liquid phase, and on surfaces are discussed with examples drawn from atmospheric,
  combustion, industrial, catalytic, and biological chemistry.
