course_description: 'This section of Expository Writing provides the opportunity for
  students- as readers, viewers, writers and speakers - to engage with social and
  ethical issues that they care deeply about. Through discussing selected documentary
  and feature films and the writings of such authors as Maya Angelou, Robert Coles,
  Charles Dickens, Barbara Ehrenreich, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jonathan Kozol, and
  Alice Walker, we will explore different perspectives on a range of social problems
  such as poverty, homelessness, and racial and gender inequality. In assigned essays,
  students will have the opportunity to write about social and ethical issues of their
  own choice. This course aims to help students to grow significantly in their ability
  to understand and grapple with arguments, to integrate secondary print and visual
  sources and to craft well-reasoned and elegant essays. Students will also keep a
  reader-writer notebook and give at least one oral presentation. In class we will
  discuss assigned films and readings, explore strategies for successful academic
  writing, freewrite and critique one another''s essays. Satisfies Phase I and CI
  Writing Requirements.
