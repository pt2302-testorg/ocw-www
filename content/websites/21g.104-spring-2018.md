course_description: 'Together with [21G.103 Chinese III](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2018/),
  this course forms the intermediate level of what constitutes a four-term foundation
  in Mandarin. Upon completion of Chinese III and IV, students should be able to speak
  Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 750 characters
  (approximately 1200 common words written in both traditional and simplified characters),
  read materials written in simple standard written Chinese, and produce both orally
  and in writing short compositions on everyday topics. Throughout the course we will
  address issues of how cultural differences inform and are informed by different
  linguistic contexts and practices.
