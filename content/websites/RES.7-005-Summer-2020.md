course_description: The MIT Biology Department supports TAs' teaching by providing
  a specialized Teaching Assistant (TA) training program in Biology Pedagogy, for
  which TAs can earn a training certificate. This program has been developed in response
  to the feedback of previous TAs, and is designed to actively meet each TA's needs
  as they are teaching. It provides practical knowledge that directly relates to their
  teaching responsibilities each week, and provides them with the opportunity to practice
  different skills and techniques in a supportive environment.
