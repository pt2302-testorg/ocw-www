course_description: 'This class does intensive close study and analysis of historically
  significant media "texts" that have been considered landmarks or have sustained
  extensive critical and scholarly discussion. Such texts may include oral epic, story
  cycles, plays, novels, films, opera, television drama and digital works. The course
  emphasizes close reading from a variety of contextual and aesthetic perspectives.
  The syllabus varies each year, and may be organized around works that have launched
  new modes and genres, works that reflect upon their own media practices, or on stories
  that migrate from one medium to another. At least one of the assigned texts is collaboratively
  taught, and visiting lectures and discussions are a regular feature of the subject.
