course_description: 'This course is concerned with Negative Polarity Items. While
  raising familiar foundational questions for linguistic theory, Negative Polarity
  Items enter into complex and often revealing interactions with a host of other phenomena
  in grammar. Investigating several such interactions, the course touches on topics
  such as focus, presupposition, exhaustification, quantification, (in)definiteness,
  modals and attitudes, comparison and superlatives, and questions.
