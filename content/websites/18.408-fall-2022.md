course_description: In this course, we will present the theory of Probabilistically
  Checkable Proofs (PCPs), and prove some fundamental consequences of it as well as
  more recent advances. More specifically, the first half of the course will be devoted
  to the (algebraic) proof of the basic PCP Theorem and basic relation to approximation
  problems. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as hardness amplification,
  the long-code framework, the Unique-Games Conjecture and its implications, and the
  2-to-2 Games Theorem.
