course_description: 'This course provides a foundation to the design of the environment
  from the scale of the object, to the building to the larger territory. The design
  disciplines of architecture as well as urbanism and landscape are examined in context
  of the larger influence of the arts and sciences. Students are expected to develop
  skills in thinking and analysis, spatial representation, and design methodologies.
  Through lectures and design exercises, students are provided an opportunity to establish
  a reference for understanding the discipline of architecture and environmental design,
  and are given an introduction to design fundamentals and the design process.
