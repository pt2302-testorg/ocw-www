course_description: 'In this course, we will survey the primary systems biology literature,
  particularly as it pertains to understanding and treating various forms of cancer.
  We will consider various computational and experimental techniques being used in
  the field of systems biology, focusing on how systems principles have helped advance
  biological understanding. We will also discuss the application of the principles
  of systems biology and network biology to drug development, an emerging discipline
  called "network medicine."


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
