course_description: "How does the global network infrastructure work and what are\
  \ the design principles on which it is based? In what ways are these design principles\
  \ compromised in practice? How do we make it work better in today's world? How do\
  \ we ensure that it will work well in the future in the face of rapidly growing\
  \ scale and heterogeneity? And how should Internet applications be written, so they\
  \ can obtain the best possible performance both for themselves and for others using\
  \ the infrastructure? These are some issues that are grappled with in this course.\
  \ The course will focus on the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation\
  \ of large-scale networked systems.\n\nTopics\_include internetworking philosophies,\
  \ unicast and multicast routing, congestion control, network quality of service,\
  \ mobile networking, router architectures, network-aware applications, content dissemination\
  \ systems, network security, and performance issues.\_Material\_for the course will\
  \ be drawn from research papers, industry white papers, and\_Internet RFCs.\n"
