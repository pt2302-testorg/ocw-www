course_description: '_Evolution of Physical Oceanography_ was created to mark the
  career of Henry M. Stommel, the leading physical oceanographer of the 20th Century
  and a longtime MIT faculty member. The authors of the different chapters were asked
  to describe the evolution of their subject over the history of physical oceanography,
  and to provide a survey of the state-of-the-art of their subject as of 1980. Many
  of the chapters in this textbook are still up-to-date descriptions of active scientific
  fields, and all of them are important historical records. This textbook is made
  available courtesy of The [MIT Press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/).
