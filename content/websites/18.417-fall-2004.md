course_description: 'This course introduces the basic computational methods used to
  understand the cell on a molecular level. It covers subjects such as the sequence
  alignment algorithms: dynamic programming, hashing, suffix trees, and Gibbs sampling.
  Furthermore, it focuses on computational approaches to: genetic and physical mapping;
  genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation; RNA expression and secondary structure;
  protein structure and folding; and molecular interactions and dynamics.
