course_description: 'This course, as a part of MIT''s [Center for Neurobiological
  Engineering curriculum](http://web.mit.edu/cnbe/training.html), explores cutting-edge
  neurotechnology that is essential for advances in all aspects of neuroscience, including
  improvements in existing methods as well as the development, testing and discussion
  of completely new paradigms. Readings and in-class sessions cover the fields of
  electrophysiology, light microscopy, cellular engineering, optogenetics, electron
  microscopy, MRI / fMRI, and MEG / EEG. The course is designed with lectures that
  cover the background, context, and theoretical descriptions of neurotechnologies,
  and labs, which provide firsthand demonstrations as well as in situ lab tours.
