course_description: This course examines the ways humans experience sound and how
  perceptions and technologies of sound emerge from cultural, economic, and historical
  worlds. It considers how the sound/noise/music boundaries have been imagined, created,
  and modeled across sociocultural and historical contexts. Students will learn how
  environmental, linguistic, and musical sounds are construed cross-culturally as
  well as the rise of telephony, architectural acoustics, sound recording, multi-channel
  and spatial mix performance, and the globalized travel of these technologies. Questions
  of sound ownership, property, authorship, remix, and copyright in the digital age
  are also addressed.
