course_description: 'This course will explore how Americans have confronted energy
  challenges since the end of World War II. Beginning in the 1970s, Americans worried
  about the supply of energy. As American production of oil declined, would the US
  be able to secure enough fuel to sustain their high consumption lifestyles? At the
  same time, Americans also began to fear the environmental side affects of energy
  use. Even if the US had enough fossil fuel, would its consumption be detrimental
  to health and safety? This class examines how Americans thought about these questions
  in the last half-century. We will consider the political, diplomatic, economic,
  cultural, and technological aspects of the energy crisis. Topics include nuclear
  power, suburbanization and the new car culture, the environmental movement and the
  challenges of clean energy, the Middle East and supply of oil, the energy crisis
  of the 1970s, and global warming.
