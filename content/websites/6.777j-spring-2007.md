course_description: '6.777J / 2.372J is an introduction to microsystem design. Topics
  covered include: material properties, microfabrication technologies, structural
  behavior, sensing methods, fluid flow, microscale transport, noise, and amplifiers
  feedback systems. Student teams design microsystems (sensors, actuators, and sensing/control
  systems) of a variety of types, (e.g., optical MEMS, bioMEMS, inertial sensors)
  to meet a set of performance specifications (e.g., sensitivity, signal-to-noise)
  using a realistic microfabrication process. There is an emphasis on modeling and
  simulation in the design process. Prior fabrication experience is desirable. The
  course is worth 4 Engineering Design Points.
