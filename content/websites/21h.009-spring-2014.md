course_description: "This course surveys the increasing interaction between communities,\
  \ as the barrier of distance succumbed to both curiosity and new transport technologies.\
  \ It explores Western Europe and the United States' rise to world dominance, as\
  \ well as the great divergence in material, political, and technological development\
  \ between Western Europe and East Asia post\u20131750, and its impact on the rest\
  \ of the world. It examines a series of evolving relationships, including human\
  \ beings and their physical environment; religious and political systems; and sub-groups\
  \ within communities, sorted by race, class, and gender. It introduces historical\
  \ and other interpretive methodologies using both primary and secondary source materials.\n"
