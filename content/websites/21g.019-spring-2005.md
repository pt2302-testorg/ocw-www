course_description: "It has become commonplace knowledge that globalization is one\
  \ of the major forces shaping our world. If we look at the spread of information,\
  \ ideas, capital, media, cultural artifacts - or for that matter, people - we can\
  \ see the boundaries and borders that have historically separated one country or\
  \ one group from another are becoming more and more permeable. For proof of this\
  \ close to home, you need only to look at the composition of the MIT student body:\_\
  8 percent of the undergraduates and 37 percent of the graduate students are from\
  \ 109 different countries.\n\n\"Communicating Across Cultures\" is designed to help\
  \ you meet the challenges of living in a world in which, increasingly, you will\
  \ be asked to interact with people who may not be like you in fundamental ways.\
  \ Its primary goals are to help you become more sensitive to intercultural communication\
  \ differences, and to provide you with the knowledge and skills that will help you\
  \ interact successfully with people from cultures other than your own. We hope the\
  \ course will accomplish those goals by exposing you to some of the best writers\
  \ and scholars on the subject of intercultural communication, and by giving you\
  \ a variety of opportunities to practice intercultural communication yourself. As\
  \ you read the syllabus for this course, we hope you get a sense of our commitment\
  \ to making this course a rewarding experience for you.\n"
