course_description: 'Media Literacy in the Age of Deepfakes aims to equip students
  with the critical skills to better understand the past and contemporary threat of
  misinformation. Students will learn about different ways to analyze emerging forms
  of misinformation such as "deepfake" videos as well as how new technologies can
  be used to create a more just and equitable society. This module consists of three
  interconnected sections. We begin by defining and contextualizing some key terms
  related to misinformation. We then focus on the proliferation of deepfakes within
  our media environment. Lastly, we explore synthetic media for the civic good, including
  AI-enabled projects geared towards satire, investigative documentary, and public
  history. In Event of Moon Disaster, an award-winning deepfake art installation about
  the "failed" Apollo 11 moon landing, serves as a central case study.


  This learning module also includes a suite of educator resources that consists of
  a syllabus, bibliography, and design prompts. We encourage teachers to draw on and
  adapt these resources for the purposes of their own classes.

  materials can be found on OCW.
