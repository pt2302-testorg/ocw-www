course_description: 'This course seeks to examine how people experience gender - what
  it means to be a man or a woman - and sexuality in a variety of historical and cultural
  contexts. We will explore how gender and sexuality relate to other categories of
  social identity and difference, such as race and ethnicity, economic and social
  standing, urban or rural life, etc. One goal of the class is to learn how to critically
  assess media and other popular representations of gender roles and stereotypes.
  Another is to gain a greater sense of the diversity of human social practices and
  beliefs in the United States and around the world.
