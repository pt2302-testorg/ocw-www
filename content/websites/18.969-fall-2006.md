course_description: 'This is an introductory (i.e. first year graduate students are
  welcome and expected) course in generalized geometry, with a special emphasis on
  Dirac geometry, as developed by Courant, Weinstein, and Severa, as well as generalized
  complex geometry, as introduced by Hitchin. Dirac geometry is based on the idea
  of unifying the geometry of a Poisson structure with that of a closed 2-form, whereas
  generalized complex geometry unifies complex and symplectic geometry. For this reason,
  the latter is intimately related to the ideas of mirror symmetry.
