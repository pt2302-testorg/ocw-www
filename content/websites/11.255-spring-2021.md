course_description: "Conventional legislative, administrative, and judicial means\
  \ of resolving resource allocation and policy\_disputes in the public sector often\
  \ produce less than satisfactory results. This is true in democracies around\_the\
  \ world. Planners, policy-makers, developers, and advocates of the poor who are\
  \ concerned about the\_fairness, efficiency, stability, and wisdom of public sector\
  \ decision-making are searching for better ways\_of resolving public policy disagreements.\
  \ Recent advances in the theory and practice of multi-party\_negotiation and dispute\
  \ resolution are, therefore, of great interest.\_\n\nThis seminar is designed for\
  \ graduate students with no prior background or experience in the fields of\_ negotiation\
  \ or dispute resolution. Lectures, scenarios, case studies, video analysis, and\
  \ role-play\_simulations are used to introduce students to the \"art\" and \"science\"\
  \ of negotiation and consensus building. The class also provides an intensive opportunity\
  \ for each student to build their personal theory of practice and to strengthen\
  \ their negotiating capabilities."
