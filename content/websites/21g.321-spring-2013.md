course_description: 'This course studies the transformation of childhood and youth
  since the 18th century in France, as well as the development of sentimentality within
  the family in a francophone context. Students will examine the personification of
  children, both as a source of inspiration for artistic creation and a political
  ideal aimed at protecting future generations, and consider various representations
  of childhood and youth in literature (e.g., Pagnol, Proust, Sarraute, Lave, Morgievre),
  movies (e.g., Truffaut), and songs (e.g., Brel, Barbara). This course is taught
  entirely in French.
