course_description: "This course is an introduction to basic ideas of geophysical\
  \ wave motion in rotating, stratified, and rotating-stratified fluids. Subject begins\
  \ with general wave concepts of phase and group velocity. It also\_covers the dynamics\
  \ and kinematics of gravity waves with a focus on dispersion, energy flux, initial\
  \ value problems, etc. Also addressed are subject foundation used to study internal\
  \ and inertial waves, Kelvin, Poincare, and Rossby waves in homogeneous and stratified\
  \ fluids. Laplace tidal equations are applied to equatorial waves. Other topics\
  \ include: resonant interactions, potential vorticity, wave-mean flow interactions,\
  \ and instability.\n"
