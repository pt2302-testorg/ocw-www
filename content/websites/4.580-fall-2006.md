course_description: 'This subject explores the varied nature and practice of computation
  in design. We will view computation and design broadly. Computation will include
  both work done on the computer (digital computing) and by-hand. Design will include
  both the process of making designs and artifacts, as well as the designs and artifacts
  themselves. The aim of the course is to develop a view of computation and design
  beyond the specifics of techniques and tools, and a critical, self-awareness of
  our own approaches and metaphors for computation and design.
