course_description: 'The main goal of this seminar will be to study the nervous system
  from the perspective of neuron-glia interactions. In each class, we will focus on
  one type of glial cell and discuss its origin, classification and function within
  the nervous system. Current findings concerning diseases associated with each type
  of glial cell will be discussed.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
