course_description: "In this Public Service Design Seminar (PSDS), we will design\
  \ and build products with developmentally disabled students at the Protestant Guild\
  \ Learning Center in Waltham, MA. The class will work closely with community clients\
  \ to make sure that what is developed is helpful and functional. These products\
  \ will be built using the Hobby Shop equipment, the water jet machine in particular.\
  \ Over the course of the seminar, this class will teach students how to use the\
  \ OMAX\xAE Jet Machining Center commonly called the water jet and associated OMAX\xAE\
  \_software. The product development process will also be detailed in depth: determining\
  \ customer needs, concept development, prototyping, design, and manufacturing.\n"
