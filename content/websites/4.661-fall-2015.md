course_description: 'This seminar is open to graduate students, and is intended to
  offer a synoptic view of selected methodologies and thinkers in art and architectural
  history (with many theorists from other fields). The syllabus outlines the structure
  of the course and the readings and assignments for each week; the goal is to become
  aware of the apparatuses of discourse, and find your own voice within them.
