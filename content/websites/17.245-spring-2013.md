course_description: 'This course examines American constitutional law in historical
  and modern context. It focuses closely on the constitutional text and Supreme Court
  case law. It explores the allocation of decision-making authority among government
  institutions, including the distribution of power across the branches of the federal
  government and between the federal and state governments. The course also examines
  the guarantees of individual rights and liberties stemming from the due process,
  equal protection, and other clauses in the Bill of Rights and post Civil War amendments.
