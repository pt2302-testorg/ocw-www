course_description: "This is a course about how research knowledge and other types\
  \ of knowledge come to be actionable and influential in the world \u2014 or not.\
  \ The course explores ways to make research knowledge more accessible, credible,\
  \ and useful in the realm of public policy and practice, a project in which the\
  \ course faculty collectively bring decades of professional experience, in both\
  \ academic and non-academic roles.\n\nThe course addresses the politics of the policymaking\
  \ process, the power of framing and agenda-setting, fads and paradigms in the design\
  \ professions and society in general, how knowledge diffuses along knowledge and\
  \ influence networks, and how varied types of knowledge (rational, craft, other)\
  \ and deliberation shape decision-making and action. The course engages a number\
  \ of guests to present case studies of research in use (and abuse) in varied fields,\
  \ highlighting rich areas for potential research contributions, along with major\
  \ conflicts in public values, political interests, ethical obligations, and more.\
  \ The resulting dilemmas confront scholars, policymakers, practitioners, and others\
  \ as they look to research \u2014 sometimes \u2014 for useful guidance, influence,\
  \ or both.\n"
