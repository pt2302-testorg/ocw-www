course_description: 'This short course provides an introduction to reactor dynamics
  including subcritical multiplication, critical operation in absence of thermal feedback
  effects and effects of Xenon, fuel and moderator temperature, etc. Topics include
  the derivation of point kinetics and dynamic period equations; techniques for reactor
  control including signal validation, supervisory algorithms, model-based trajectory
  tracking, and rule-based control; and an overview of light-water reactor startup.
  Lectures and demonstrations employ computer simulation and the use of the MIT Research
  Reactor.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
