course_description: 'This class provides an introduction to the interactions between
  cells and the surfaces of biomaterials. The course covers: surface chemistry and
  physics of selected metals, polymers, and ceramics; surface characterization methodology;
  modification of biomaterials surfaces; quantitative assays of cell behavior in culture;
  biosensors and microarrays; bulk properties of implants; and acute and chronic response
  to implanted biomaterials. General topics include biosensors, drug delivery, and
  tissue engineering.
