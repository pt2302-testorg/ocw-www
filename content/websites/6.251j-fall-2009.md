course_description: 'This course is an introduction to linear optimization and its
  extensions emphasizing the underlying mathematical structures, geometrical ideas,
  algorithms and solutions of practical problems. The topics covered include: formulations,
  the geometry of linear optimization, duality theory, the simplex method, sensitivity
  analysis, robust optimization, large scale optimization network flows, solving problems
  with an exponential number of constraints and the ellipsoid method, interior point
  methods, semidefinite optimization, solving real world problems problems with computer
  software, discrete optimization formulations and algorithms.
