course_description: 'This course begins with a study of the role of dynamics in the
  general physics of the atmosphere, the consideration of the differences between
  modeling and approximation, and the observed large-scale phenomenology of the atmosphere.
  Only then are the basic equations derived in rigorous manner. The equations are
  then applied to important problems and methodologies in meteorology and climate,
  with discussions of the history of the topics where appropriate. Problems include
  the Hadley circulation and its role in the general circulation, atmospheric waves
  including gravity and Rossby waves and their interaction with the mean flow, with
  specific applications to the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation, tides, the
  super-rotation of Venus'' atmosphere, the generation of atmospheric turbulence,
  and stationary waves among other problems. The quasi-geostrophic approximation is
  derived, and the resulting equations are used to examine the hydrodynamic stability
  of the circulation with applications ranging from convective adjustment to climate.
