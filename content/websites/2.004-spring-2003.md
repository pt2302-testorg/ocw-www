course_description: 'This course is the second subject of a two-term sequence on modeling,
  analysis and control of dynamic systems. Topics covered include:


  *   kinematics and dynamics of mechanical systems, including rigid bodies in plane
  motion

  *   linear and angular momentum principles

  *   impact and collision problems

  *   linearization about equilibrium

  *   free and forced vibrations

  *   sensors and actuators

  *   control of mechanical systems

  *   integral and derivative action, lead and lag compensators

  *   root-locus design methods

  *   frequency-domain design methods

  *   applications to case-studies of multi-domain systems
