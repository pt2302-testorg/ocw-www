course_description: 'This course covers concepts and techniques for the design and
  implementation of large software systems that can be adapted to uses not anticipated
  by the designer. Applications include compilers, computer-algebra systems, deductive
  systems, and some artificial intelligence applications. Topics include combinators,
  generic operations, pattern matching, pattern-directed invocation, rule systems,
  backtracking, dependencies, indeterminacy, memoization, constraint propagation,
  and incremental refinement. Substantial weekly programming assignments are an integral
  part of the subject.


  There will be extensive programming assignments, using [MIT/GNU Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/).
  Students should have significant programming experience in Scheme, Common Lisp,
  Haskell, CAML or some other "functional" language.
