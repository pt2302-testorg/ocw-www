course_description: "\"Designing a dream city is easy. Rebuilding a living one takes\
  \ imagination.\"\_\_\_ -Jane Jacobs\n\nThis course examines the challenges that\
  \ cities will face and strategies they can use to prepare for the impacts of climate\
  \ change. Particular attention will be paid to the presence of global disparities,\
  \ the needs of vulnerable populations and resource constrained locales, and the\
  \ ways in which local government and community-based activities can achieve equitable\
  \ levels of climate-readiness.\n"
