course_description: 'We function in our personal and professional lives based on knowledge
  and intuitions. Our intuition that we know a lot is very powerful. But sometimes
  intuitions are accurate and sometimes they are not; without research, it is hard
  to tell.


  This course combines a few different goals: develop a critical eye for making inferences
  from data; be able to carry out simple data analysis; learn about managerial psychology;
  develop interesting new questions about managerial psychology and test these questions.
