course_description: 'This course considers how the visual and material world of "nature"
  has been reshaped by industrial practices, ideologies, and institutions, particularly
  in nineteenth- and twentieth-century America. Topics include land-use patterns;
  the changing shape of cities and farms; the redesign of water systems; the construction
  of roads, dams, bridges, irrigation systems; the creation of national parks; ideas
  about wilderness; and the role of nature in an industrial world. From small farms
  to suburbia, Walden Pond to Yosemite, we will ask how technological and natural
  forces have interacted, and whether there is a place for nature in a technological
  world.
