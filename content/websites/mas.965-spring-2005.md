course_description: 'This course examines the issues, principles, and challenges toward
  building relational machines through a combination of studio-style design and critique
  along with lecture, lively discussion of course readings, and assignments. Insights
  from social psychology, human-computer interaction, and design will be examined,
  as well as how these ideas are manifest in a broad range of applications for software
  agents and robots.
