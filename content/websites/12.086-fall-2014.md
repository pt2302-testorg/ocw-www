course_description: "This course provides an introduction to the study of environmental\
  \ phenomena that exhibit both organized structure and wide variability\u2014i.e.,\
  \ complexity. Through focused study of a variety of physical, biological, and chemical\
  \ problems in conjunction with theoretical models, we learn a series of lessons\
  \ with wide applicability to understanding the structure and organization of the\
  \ natural world. Students also learn how to construct minimal mathematical, physical,\
  \ and computational models that provide informative answers to precise questions.\n\
  \nThis course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates. Beginning graduate students\
  \ are encouraged to register for 12.586 (graduate version of 12.086). Students taking\
  \ the graduate version complete different assignments.\n"
