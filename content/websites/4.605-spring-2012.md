course_description: 'This course is a global-oriented survey of the history of architecture,
  from the prehistoric to the sixteenth century. It treats buildings and environments,
  including cities, in the context of the cultural and civilizational history. It
  offers an introduction to design principles and analysis. Being global, it aims
  to give the student perspective on the larger pushes and pulls that influence architecture
  and its meanings, whether these be economic, political, religious or climatic.
