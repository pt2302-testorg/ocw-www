course_description: 'In this class you will be creating a leadership development tool
  for students like yourselves in the leadership program at Sloan. This tool might
  be a coaching guide for second-year pilots, a leadership workbook for MBA students
  to use during their summer employment, a leadership assessment for club presidents
  or a workshop on networking. You will be free to choose the tool that you want to
  develop, but by the end of the class there must be a product that can be used at
  Sloan. In addition, the tools must link in some way to the leadership model used
  at Sloan.
