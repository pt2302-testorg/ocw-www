course_description: "This course explores the problem of intelligence\u2014its nature,\
  \ how it is produced by the brain and how it could be replicated in machines\u2014\
  using an approach that integrates cognitive science, which studies the mind; neuroscience,\
  \ which studies the brain; and computer science and artificial intelligence, which\
  \ study the computations needed to develop intelligent machines. Materials are drawn\
  \ from the [Brains, Minds and Machines Summer Course](http://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school)\
  \ offered annually at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, taught\
  \ by faculty affiliated with the [Center for Brains, Minds and Machines](http://cbmm.mit.edu)\
  \ headquartered at MIT. Elements of the summer course are integrated into the MIT\
  \ course, _9.523 Aspects of a Computational Theory of Intelligence._\n\nContributors\n\
  ------------\n\nThis course includes the contributions of many instructors, guest\
  \ speakers, and a team of iCub researchers. See the [complete list of contributors](/courses/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/pages/syllabus/course-instructors-guest-speakers-and-icub-team).\n"
