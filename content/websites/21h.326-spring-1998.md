course_description: 'Medieval and early modern Russia stood at the crossroads of Europe
  and Asia. In this course we will examine some of the native developments and foreign
  influences which most affected the course of Russian history. Particular topics
  include the rise of the Kievan State, the Mongol Yoke, the rise of Muscovy, Ivan
  the Terrible, Peter the Great, relations with Western Europe. How did foreigners
  perceive Russia? How did those living in the Russian lands perceive foreigners?
  What social relations were developing between nobility and peasantry, town and country,
  women and men? What were the relations of each of these groups to the state? How
  did state formation come about in Kievan and Muscovite Russia? What were the political,
  religious, economic, and social factors affecting relations between state and society?
  In examining these questions we will consider a variety of sources including contemporary
  accounts (both domestic and foreign), legal and political documents, historical
  monographs and interpretive essays.
