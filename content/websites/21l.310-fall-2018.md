course_description: "This class uses a range of literary texts to trace the growth\
  \ of the vampire trope from its first appearance in English-language fiction in\
  \ the early years of the nineteenth century. Centering on classic works by Lord\
  \ Byron, John Polidori, Sheridan le Fanu, Bram Stoker, and others, we learn about\
  \ the formation of the modern literary canon, the folklore of the undead, and the\
  \ creation of one of the most prolific popular culture genres\u2014vampire fiction\u2014\
  which reached its first apotheosis in Stoker\u2019s masterwork, _Dracula_.\n"
