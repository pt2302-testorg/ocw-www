course_description: "In this class, you will read, think about, and (I hope) enjoy\
  \ important examples of what has become one of the most popular literary genres\
  \ today, if not the most popular: the novel. Some of the questions we will consider\
  \ are: Why did so many novels appear in the eighteenth century? Why were they\u2014\
  and are they\u2014called novels? Who wrote them? Who read them? Who narrates them?\
  \ What are they likely to be about? Do they have distinctive characteristics? What\
  \ is their relationship to the time and place in which they appeared? How have they\
  \ changed over the years? And, most of all, why do we like to read them so much?\n"
