course_description: 'This course introduces diverse meanings and uses of the concept
  of culture with historical and contemporary examples from scholarship and popular
  media around the globe. It includes first-hand observations, synthesized histories
  and ethnographies, quantitative representations, and visual and fictionalized accounts
  of human experiences. Students conduct empirical research on cultural differences
  through the systematic observation of human interaction, employ methods of interpretative
  analysis, and practice convincing others of the accuracy of their findings.
