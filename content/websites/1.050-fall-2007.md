course_description: 'This subject provides an introduction to the mechanics of materials
  and structures. You will be introduced to and become familiar with all relevant
  physical properties and fundamental laws governing the behavior of materials and
  structures and you will learn how to solve a variety of problems of interest to
  civil and environmental engineers. While there will be a chance for you to put your
  mathematical skills obtained in 18.01, 18.02, and eventually 18.03 to use in this
  subject, the emphasis is on the physical understanding of why a material or structure
  behaves the way it does in the engineering design of materials and structures.
