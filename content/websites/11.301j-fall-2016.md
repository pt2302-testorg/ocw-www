course_description: 'This course examines both the structure of cities and the ways
  they can be changed. It introduces graduate students to theories about how cities
  are formed, and the practice of urban design and development, using U.S. and international
  examples. The course is organized into two parts: Part 1 analyzes the forces which
  act to shape and to change cities; Part 2 surveys key models of physical form and
  social intervention that have been deployed to resolve competing forces acting on
  the city. This course includes models of urban analysis, contemporary theories of
  urban design, and implementation strategies. Lectures in this course are supplemented
  by discussion periods, student work, and field trips.
