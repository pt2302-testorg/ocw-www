course_description: 'This course will provide an overview of a new vision for Human-Computer
  Interaction (HCI) in which people are surrounded by intelligent and intuitive interfaces
  embedded in the everyday objects around them. It will focus on understanding enabling
  technologies and studying applications and experiments, and, to a lesser extent,
  it will address the socio-cultural impact. Students will read and discuss the most
  relevant articles in related areas: smart environments, smart networked objects,
  augmented and mixed realities, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, tangible
  computing, intelligent interfaces and wearable computing. Finally, they will be
  asked to come up with new ideas and start innovative projects in this area.
