course_description: "How does one writer use another writer's work?\_Does it matter\
  \ if one author has been dead 300 years? What difference does it make if she's a\
  \ groundbreaking twentieth-century feminist and the writer she values has come to\
  \ epitomize the English literary tradition? How can a novelist borrow from plays\
  \ and poems? By reading Virginia Woolf's major novels and essays in juxtaposition\
  \ with some of the Shakespeare plays that (depending on one's interpretation) haunt,\
  \ enrich, and/or shape her writing, we will try to answer these questions and raise\
  \ others. Readings in literary criticism, women's studies, and other literary texts\
  \ will complement our focus on the relationship--across time, media, and gender--between\
  \ Shakespeare and Woolf.\_As a seminar, we will work to become more astute readers\
  \ of literature within its historical, artistic, and political contexts, and consider\
  \ how literature both reflects and contributes to these societal frameworks.\_Central\
  \ texts will include Shakespeare's _Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Cymbeline_, and\
  \ _The Winter's Tale_, and Woolf's _A Room of One's Own_, _Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando,\
  \ To the Lighthouse, The Waves,_ and _Between the Acts_. This subject is an advanced\
  \ seminar in both the Literature and the Women's Studies Program.\n"
