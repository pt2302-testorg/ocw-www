course_description: "Imagine you are a salesman needing to visit 100 cities connected\
  \ by a set of roads. Can you do it while stopping in each city only once? Even a\
  \ supercomputer working at 1 trillion operations per second would take longer than\
  \ the age of the universe to find a solution when considering each possibility in\
  \ turn. In 1994, Leonard Adleman published a paper in which he described a solution,\
  \ using the tools of molecular biology, for a smaller 7-city example of this problem.\
  \ His paper generated enormous scientific and public interest, and kick-started\
  \ the field of Biological Computing, the main subject of this discussion based seminar\
  \ course. Students will analyze the Adleman paper, and the papers that preceded\
  \ and followed it, with an eye for identifying the engineering and scientific aspects\
  \ of each paper, emphasizing the interplay of these two approaches in the field\
  \ of Biological Computing. This course is appropriate for both biology and non-biology\
  \ majors. Care will be taken to fill in any knowledge gaps for both scientists and\
  \ engineers.\n\nThis course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting.\n"
