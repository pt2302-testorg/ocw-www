course_description: 'Probability theory captures a number of essential characteristics
  of human cognition, including aspects of perception, reasoning, belief revision,
  and learning. Expressions of degree of belief were used in language long before
  people began codifying the laws of probability theory. This course explores the
  history and debates over codifying the laws of probability, how probability theory
  applies to specific cognitive processes, how it relates to the human understanding
  of causality, and how new computational approaches to causal modeling provide a
  framework for understanding human probabilistic reasoning.


  This class is suitable for advanced undergraduates or graduate students specializing
  in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.
