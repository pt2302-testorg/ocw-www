course_description: 'The strategic importance of information technology is now widely
  accepted. It has also become increasingly clear that the identification of strategic
  applications alone does not result in success for an organization. A careful coordination
  of strategic applications, information technologies, and organizational structures
  must be made to attain success. This course addresses strategic, technological,
  and organizational connectivity issues to support effective and meaningful integration
  of information and systems. This course is especially relevant to those who wish
  to effectively exploit information technology and create new business processes
  and opportunities.
