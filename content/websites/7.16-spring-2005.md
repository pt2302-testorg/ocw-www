course_description: 'The course applies molecular biology and reverse genetics approaches
  to the study of apoptosis, or programmed cell death (PCD), in Drosophila cells.
  RNA interference (RNAi), or double stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing, will be
  used to inhibit expression of candidate apoptosis-related genes in cultured Drosophila
  cells. Teams of 2 or 3 students will design and carry out experiments to address
  questions about the genes involved in the regulation and execution of PCD in this
  system. Some projects involve the use of DNA damaging agents or other cytotoxic
  chemicals or drugs to help understand the pathways that control a cell''s decision
  to undergo apoptosis. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication
  are provided.
