course_description: 'This course provides students with a scientific foundation of
  anthropogenic climate change and an introduction to climate models. It focuses on
  fundamental physical processes that shape climate (e.g. solar variability, orbital
  mechanics, greenhouse gases, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and volcanic and
  soil aerosols) and on evidence for past and present climate change. During the course
  they discuss material consequences of climate change, including sea level change,
  variations in precipitation, vegetation, storminess, and the incidence of disease.
  This course also examines the science behind mitigation and adaptation proposals.
