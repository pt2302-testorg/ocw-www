course_description: "This subject serves as a broad introduction to the field of European\
  \ and Latin American fiction. It is taught in an historical manner\u2014beginning\
  \ with the first picaresque novel, _Lazarillo de Tormes_, and ending with contemporary\
  \ European fiction. It is designed to help students acquire a general understanding\
  \ of major fictional modes-from 18th century epistolary fiction, _Liaisons dangereuses_,\
  \ to 20th century avant-garde fiction: _Cosmicomicsi_ and _Aura_. Attention is paid\
  \ not only to the literary movements these works represent, but also to the subtle\
  \ interplay of history, geography, language and cultural norms that gave rise to\
  \ specific literary forms. While the reading load is heavy, the books are compelling.\n"
