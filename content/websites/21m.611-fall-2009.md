course_description: 'The goals of this class are two-fold: the first is to experience
  the creative processes and storytelling behind several of theater''s arts and to
  acquire the analytical skills necessary in assessing the meaning they transmit when
  they come together in production. Secondly, we will introduce you to these languages
  in a creative way by giving you hands-on experience in each. To that end, several
  Visiting Artists and MIT faculty in Theater Arts will guest lecture, lead workshops,
  and give you practical instruction in their individual art forms.
