course_description: 'This course will consider the ways in which technology, broadly
  defined, has contributed to the building of American society from colonial times
  to the present. This course has three primary goals: to train students to ask critical
  questions of both technology and the broader American culture of which it is a part;
  to provide an historical perspective with which to frame and address such questions;
  and to encourage students to be neither blind critics of new technologies, nor blind
  advocates for technologies in general, but thoughtful and educated participants
  in the democratic process.
