course_description: "Algebra II is the second semester of a year-long introduction\
  \ to modern algebra. The course focuses on group representations, rings, ideals,\
  \ fields, polynomial rings, modules, factorization, integers in quadratic number\
  \ fields, field extensions, and Galois theory.\n\nThese notes, which were created\
  \ by students in a recent on-campus 18.702 Algebra II class, are offered here to\
  \ supplement the materials included in OCW\u2019s\_[version of 18.702](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-702-algebra-ii-spring-2011/).\
  \ They have not been checked for accuracy by the instructors of that class or by\
  \ other MIT faculty members."
