course_description: "This subject traces the history of the European novel by studying\
  \ texts that have been influential in connection with two interrelated ideas. (1)\
  \ When serious fiction deals with matters of great consequence, it should not deal\
  \ with the actions of persons of consequence\u2014kings, princes, high elected officials\
  \ and the like\u2014but rather with the lives of apparently ordinary people and\
  \ the everyday details of their social ambitions and desires. To use a phrase of\
  \ Balzac's, serious fiction deals with \"what happens everywhere\". (2) This idea\
  \ sometimes goes with another: that the most significant representations of the\
  \ human condition are those dealing with persons who try to compel society to accept\
  \ them as its destined agent, despite their absence of high birth or inheritance.\n"
