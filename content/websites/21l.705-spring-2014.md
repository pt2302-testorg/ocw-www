course_description: "h\u01BF\xE6t \u01BFe gardena in geardagum \xFEeodcyninga \xFE\
  rym gefrunon hu \xF0a \xE6\xFEelingas ellen fremedon\u2026. Those are the first\
  \ words of the Old English epic _Beowulf_, and in this class you will learn to read\
  \ them.\n\nBesides being the language of Rohan in the novels of Tolkien, Old English\
  \ (also called Anglo-Saxon) is a language of long, cold, and lonely winters; of\
  \ haunting beauty found in unexpected places; and of unshakable resolve in the face\
  \ of insurmountable odds.\n\nIt is, in short, the perfect language for MIT students.\n\
  \nAfter learning the basics of grammar and vocabulary, we will read not just excerpts\
  \ from the great _Beowulf_ but also heartrending laments (_The Wanderer, The Wife's\
  \ Lament_), an account of the Crucifixion as narrated by the Cross itself (_The\
  \ Dream of the Rood_), and a host of riddles whose solutions range from the sacred\
  \ to the obscene but are always ingenious. We will also try our hand at composing\
  \ our own sentences\u2014and maybe even poems\u2014in Old English.\n"
