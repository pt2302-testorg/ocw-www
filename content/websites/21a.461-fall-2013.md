course_description: "As we live in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2008,\
  \ there are renewed questions about the nature of the economic system\u2014capitalism\u2014\
  within which we live. What are its benefits and drawbacks? Why does it garner both\
  \ so much opposition and support? What are its moral, economic, social and political\
  \ implications? Is it even a \"system\"? How has capitalism played out in different\
  \ historical moments and regions of the world? This class addresses the question\
  \ \"what is capitalism?\" from a social scientific point of view, rather than a\
  \ classical economic one.\n"
