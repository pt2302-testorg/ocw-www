course_description: 'This course seeks to provide students with a general understanding
  of the form of collective action known as the social movement. Our task will be
  guided by the close examination of several twentieth century social movements in
  the United States. We will read about the U.S. civil rights, the unemployed workers'',
  welfare rights, pro-choice / pro-life and gay rights movements. We will compare
  and contrast certain of these movements with their counterparts in other countries.
  For all, we will identify the reasons for their successes and failures.
