course_description: "This course provides an introductory survey of data science tools\
  \ in healthcare.\_It was created by members of [MIT Critical Data](https://criticaldata.mit.edu/),\
  \ a global consortium consisting of healthcare practitioners, computer scientists,\
  \ and engineers from academia, industry, and government, that seeks to place data\
  \ and research at the front and center of healthcare operations.\n\nThe most daunting\
  \ global health issues right now are the result of interconnected crises. In this\
  \ course, we highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to health\
  \ data science. It is intended for front-line clinicians and public health practitioners,\
  \ as well as computer scientists, engineers, and social scientists, whose goal is\
  \ to understand health and disease better using digital data captured in the process\
  \ of care.\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n\n*   Principles of data science as applied to\
  \ health\n*   Analysis of electronic health records\n*   Artificial intelligence\
  \ and machine learning in healthcare\n\nThis course is part of the [Open Learning\
  \ Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
  \ without enrolling.\n"
