course_description: "This hands-on survey course deals with the fundamentals and application\
  \ of environmental urban performance simulations to urban design. Core topics include\
  \ operational and embodied building energy use and affiliated carbon emissions,\
  \ access to daylight, neighborhood walkability, and outdoor thermal comfort. Additional\
  \ topics that we will be reviewing are basic cash flow models to compare the economic\
  \ viability of competing neighborhood proposals including health \u201Cco-benefits\u201D\
  \ as well as the simulation of crop yields from urban container farms."
