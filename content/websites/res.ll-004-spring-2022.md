course_description: "Welcome to \u201CIntroduction to Engineering Concepts,\" a lesson\
  \ that will introduce you to several STEM fields and help you build core skills\
  \ that are helpful across many engineering disciplines. We also explain the engineering/research\
  \ development process. This lesson assumes little to no prior engineering experience\
  \ but does provide suggestions to increase the difficulty of the experiments should\
  \ you desire to do so.\n\nThis course is provided by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, a research\
  \ and development laboratory focusing on advanced technologies to meet critical\
  \ national security needs."
