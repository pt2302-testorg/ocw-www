course_description: 'This course is primarily a literature seminar. We will use American
  literature as a lens through which to examine different passing tropes. It will
  provide an introduction to queer, gender, and critical race theories for science
  and math majors. We will read such works as _Running A Thousand Miles for Freedom_,
  _Incognegro_, and Focault''s _A History of Sexuality_, to name just a few.
