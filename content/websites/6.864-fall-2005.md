course_description: 'This course is a graduate introduction to natural language processing
  - the study of human language from a computational perspective. It covers syntactic,
  semantic and discourse processing models, emphasizing machine learning or corpus-based
  methods and algorithms. It also covers applications of these methods and models
  in syntactic parsing, information extraction, statistical machine translation, dialogue
  systems, and summarization. The subject qualifies as an Artificial Intelligence
  and Applications concentration subject.
