course_description: "Focus: What can we believe when we read an autobiography? How\
  \ do writers recall, select, shape, and present their lives to construct life stories?\_\
  \ Readings that ground these questions include selections from _Incidents in the\
  \ Life of a Slave Girl_ by Linda Brent (pseudonym for Harriet Jacobs), \"A Sketch\
  \ of the Past\" by Virginia Woolf, Notes of A Native Son by James Baldwin, \"The\
  \ Achievement of Desire\" by Richard Rodriguez, _The Woman Warrior_ by Maxine Hong\
  \ Kingston, and \"Our Secret\" by Susan Griffin. Discussion, papers, and brief oral\
  \ presentations will focus on the content of the life stories as well as the forms\
  \ and techniques authors use to shape autobiography. We will identify masks and\
  \ stances used to achieve various goals, sources and interrelationships of technical\
  \ and thematic concerns, and \"fictions\" of autobiographical writing. Assignments\
  \ will allow students to consider texts in terms of their implicit theories of autobiography,\
  \ of theories we read, and of students' experiences; assignments also allow some\
  \ autobiographical writing.\n"
