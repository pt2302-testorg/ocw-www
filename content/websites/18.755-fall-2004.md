course_description: "This course is devoted to the theory of Lie Groups with emphasis\
  \ on its connections with Differential Geometry. The text for this class is\_[_Differential\
  \ Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces_](http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&arg1=gsmseries&item=GSM-34)\
  \ by Sigurdur Helgason (American Mathematical Society, 2001).\n\nMuch of the course\
  \ material is based on Chapter\_I (first half) and Chapter\_II of the text. The\
  \ text however develops basic Riemannian Geometry, Complex Manifolds, as well as\
  \ a detailed theory of Semisimple Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces.\n"
