course_description: 'This course examines works of film in relation to thematic issues
  of philosophical importance that also occur in other arts, particularly literature
  and opera. Emphasis is put on film''s ability to represent and express feeling as
  well as cognition. Both written and cinematic works by Sturges, Shaw, Cocteau, Hitchcock,
  Joyce, and Bergman, among others, are considered. There are no tests or quizzes,
  however students write two major papers on media/philosophical research topics of
  their choosing.
