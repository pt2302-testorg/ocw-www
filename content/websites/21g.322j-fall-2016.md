course_description: "This course approaches the question of what constitutes Frenchness\
  \ in today's era of globalization through issues of memory, belonging, and cultural\
  \ production. It explores the role of timeless traditions \u2013 common technologies,\
  \ an internationally-spoken language, monuments open to the world, and foods such\
  \ as wine and cheese \u2013 that remain quintessentially French. The course also\
  \ covers recent scandals about France's role in the world, such as its colonial\
  \ identity and Dominique Strauss-Kahn's New York debacle.\n\nTaught in French.\n"
