course_description: 'Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources
  that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory
  mathematics courses. _Multivariable Calculus_ is the second course in the series,
  consisting of 26 videos, 4 Study Guides, and a set of Supplementary Notes. The series
  was first released in 1971 as a way for people to review the essentials of calculus.
  It is equally valuable for students who are learning calculus for the first time.
