course_description: 'This subject is designed for upper level undergraduates and graduate
  students as an introduction to politics and the policy process in modern Japan.
  The semester is divided into two parts. After a two-week general introduction to
  Japan and to the dominant approaches to the study of Japanese history, politics
  and society, we will begin exploring five aspects of Japanese politics: party politics,
  electoral politics, interest group politics, bureaucratic politics, and policy,
  which will be broken up into seven additional sections. We will try to understand
  the ways in which the actors and institutions identified in the first part of the
  semester affect the policy process across a variety of issues areas.
