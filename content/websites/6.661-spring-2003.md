course_description: "This course explores the detection and measurement of radio and\
  \ optical signals encountered in communications, astronomy, remote sensing, instrumentation,\
  \ and radar. Topics covered include: statistical analysis of signal processing systems,\
  \ including radiometers, spectrometers, interferometers, and digital correlation\
  \ systems; matched filters and ambiguity functions; communications channel performance;\
  \ measurement of random electromagnetic fields, angular filtering properties of\
  \ antennas, interferometers, and aperture synthesis systems; and\_radiative transfer\
  \ and parameter estimation.\n"
