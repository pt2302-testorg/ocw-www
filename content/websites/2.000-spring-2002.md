course_description: 'Subject studies how and why machines work, how they are conceived,
  how they are developed (drawn), and how they are utilized. Students learn from the
  hands-on experiences of taking things apart mentally and physically, drawing (sketching,
  3D CAD) what they envision and observe, taking occasional field trips, and completing
  an individual term project (concept, creation, and presentation). Emphasis on understanding
  the physics and history of machines.
