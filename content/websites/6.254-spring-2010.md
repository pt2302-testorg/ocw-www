course_description: 'This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of game theory
  and mechanism design. Motivations are drawn from engineered/networked systems (including
  distributed control of wireline and wireless communication networks, incentive-compatible/dynamic
  resource allocation, multi-agent systems, pricing and investment decisions in the
  Internet), and social models (including social and economic networks). The course
  emphasizes theoretical foundations, mathematical tools, modeling, and equilibrium
  notions in different environments.
