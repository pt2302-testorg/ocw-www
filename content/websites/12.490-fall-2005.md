course_description: 'Advanced Igneous Petrology covers the history of and recent developments
  in the study of igneous rocks. Students review the chemistry and structure of igneous
  rock-forming minerals and proceed to study how these minerals occur and interact
  in igneous rocks. The course focuses on igneous processes and how we have learned
  about them through studying a number of significant sites worldwide.
