course_description: 'This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level
  systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic networks,
  cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics. Cellular systems include genetic
  switches and oscillators, network motifs, genetic network evolution, and cellular
  decision-making. Population-level systems include models of pattern formation, cell-cell
  communication, and evolutionary systems biology.
