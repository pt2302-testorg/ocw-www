course_description: "The Renaissance has justly become both famous and notorious as\
  \ an age of discovery, and its voyages took place in many realms. This semester,\
  \ we will read several history making narratives of early modern travel: first-hand\
  \ accounts of discovery, captivity, conquest, or cultural encounter. As Europeans\
  \ came to acquire experience of unfamiliar places, literary texts of the period\
  \ began to assimilate this experience by describing imagined voyages across real\
  \ or fantastic landscapes. Finally, voyages of exploration served Renaissance writers\
  \ as a metaphor: for intellectual inquiry, for spiritual development, or for the\
  \ pursuit of love. Among the literary genres sampled this semester will be sonnets,\
  \ plays, prose narratives, utopias, and chivalric romance. Authors and travellers\
  \ will include Francis Petrarch, Amerigo Vespucci, Thomas More, Christopher Marlowe,\
  \ Edmund Spenser, Hern\xE1n Cort\xE9s, John Donne, Francis Drake, Mary Rowlandson,\
  \ Francis Bacon.\n"
