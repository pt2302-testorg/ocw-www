course_description: 'This class serves as an introduction to mass transport in environmental
  flows, with emphasis given to river and lake systems. The class will cover the derivation
  and solutions to the differential form of mass conservation equations. Class topics
  to be covered will include: molecular and turbulent diffusion, boundary layers,
  dissolution, bed-water exchange, air-water exchange and particle transport.
