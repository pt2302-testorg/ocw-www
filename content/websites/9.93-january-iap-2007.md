course_description: 'This seminar focuses on the cognitive science of moral reasoning.
  Philosophers debate how we decide which moral actions are permissible. Is it permissible
  to take one human life in order to save others? We have powerful and surprisingly
  rich and subtle intuitions to such questions.


  In this class, you will learn how intuitions can be studied using formal analytical
  paradigms and behavioral experiments. Thursday evening, meet to learn about recent
  advances in theories of moral reasoning. Overnight, formulate a hypothesis about
  the structure of moral reasoning and design a questionnaire-based experiment to
  test this. Friday, present and select 1-2 proposals and collect data; we will then
  reconvene to analyze and discuss results and implications for the structure of the
  moral mind.


  This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
  a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
  end of the month.
