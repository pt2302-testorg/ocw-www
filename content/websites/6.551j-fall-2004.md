course_description: "The Acoustics of Speech and Hearing is an H-Level graduate course\
  \ that reviews the physical processes involved in the production, propagation and\
  \ reception of human speech. Particular attention is paid to how the acoustics and\
  \ mechanics of the speech and auditory system define what sounds we are capable\
  \ of producing and what sounds we can sense. Areas of discussion include:\n\n1.\
  \  the acoustic cues used in determining the direction of a sound source,\n2.  the\
  \ acoustic and mechanical mechanisms involved in speech production and\n    \n3.\
  \  the acoustic and mechanical mechanism used to transduce and analyze sounds in\
  \ the ear.\n"
