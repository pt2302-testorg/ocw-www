course_description: "This course presents an introduction to quantum mechanics. It\
  \ begins with an examination of the historical development of quantum theory, properties\
  \ of particles and waves, wave mechanics and applications to simple systems \u2014\
  \ the particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, the rigid rotor and the hydrogen\
  \ atom. The lectures continue with a discussion of atomic structure and the Periodic\
  \ Table. The final lectures cover applications to chemical bonding including valence\
  \ bond and molecular orbital theory, molecular structure, spectroscopy.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\
  ----------------\n\nThe material for 5.61 has evolved over a period of many years,\
  \ and, accordingly, several faculty members have contributed to the development\
  \ of the course contents. The original version of the lecture notes that are available\
  \ on OCW was prepared in the early 1990's by Prof. Sylvia T. Ceyer. These were revised\
  \ and transcribed to electronic form primarily by Prof. Keith A. Nelson. The current\
  \ version includes additional contributions by Professors Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert\
  \ W. Field, Robert G. Griffin, Robert J. Silbey and John S. Waugh, all of whom have\
  \ taught the course in the recent past.\n"
