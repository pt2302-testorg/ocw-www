course_description: 'This practicum subject integrates theory and practice through
  the design, implementation, and evaluation of a comprehensive community information
  infrastructure that promotes democratic involvement and informs community development
  projects. Students work with Lawrence Community Works, Inc. to involve constituents
  and generate solutions to an important planning problem in the City of Lawrence,
  Massachusetts. Final project presentations take place in a public forum, and serve
  to inform future development of the information infrastructure. Subject begins with
  an overview of the digital divide, e-government, public participation GIS, and neighborhood
  information systems. Subject includes a reflection component and a deliberate investigation
  of race, class, and gender dynamics.
