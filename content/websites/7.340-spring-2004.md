course_description: 'Every infection consists of a battle between the invading pathogen
  and the resisting host. To be successful, a pathogen must escape the many defenses
  of the host immune system until it can replicate and spread to another host. A pathogen
  must prevent one of three stages of immune function: detection, activation, or effector
  function. Examples of disease-specific immune evasion and the mechanisms used by
  pathogens to prevail over their hosts'' immune systems are discussed. Also considered
  is what these host-pathogen interactions reveal about the normal function of the
  immune system and basic cell biological processes, such as protein maturation and
  degradation.
