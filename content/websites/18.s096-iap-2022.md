course_description: 'We all know that calculus courses such as [*18.01 Single Variable
  Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)
  and [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
  cover univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as
  machine learning require the next big step, matrix calculus.


  This class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that
  allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), compute
  derivatives of important matrix factorizations, and really understand forward and
  reverse modes of differentiation. We will discuss adjoint methods, custom Jacobian
  matrix vector products, and how modern automatic differentiation is more computer
  science than mathematics in that it is neither symbolic nor based on finite differences.'
