course_description: Differential Equations are the language in which the laws of nature
  are expressed. Understanding properties of solutions of differential equations is
  fundamental to much of contemporary science and engineering. Ordinary differential
  equations (ODE's) deal with functions of one variable, which can often be thought
  of as time.
