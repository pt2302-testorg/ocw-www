course_description: 'This course explores statistical modeling and control in manufacturing
  processes. Topics include the use of experimental design and response surface modeling
  to understand manufacturing process physics, as well as defect and parametric yield
  modeling and optimization. Various forms of process control, including statistical
  process control, run by run and adaptive control, and real-time feedback control,
  are covered. Application contexts include semiconductor manufacturing, conventional
  metal and polymer processing, and emerging micro-nano manufacturing processes.
