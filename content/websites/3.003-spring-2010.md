course_description: 'This class introduces students to the interdisciplinary nature
  of 21st-century engineering projects with three threads of learning: a technical
  toolkit, a social science toolkit, and a methodology for problem-based learning.
  Students encounter the social, political, economic, and technological challenges
  of engineering practice by participating in real engineering projects with faculty
  and industry; this semester''s major project focuses on the engineering and economics
  of solar cells. Student teams will create prototypes and mixed media reports with
  exercises in project planning, analysis, design, optimization, demonstration, reporting
  and team building.
