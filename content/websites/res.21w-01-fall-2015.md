course_description: '_Angles_ is an annual online magazine of exemplary writing by
  MIT students. All of the works published in _Angles_ since its first edition in
  2008 were written by students in the introductory writing courses. These courses,
  designated as CI-HW (Communications-Intensive Humanities Writing) subjects, bring
  together students who love to write, students who struggle with writing, students
  who thrive in seminar-style classes, and students who just want a chance to develop
  their English skills. These students prosper together and produce some remarkable
  work. Angles has provided them with a public outlet for that work. It also provides
  the CI-HW instructors with material that inspires and guides their current students.


  In these classes, students learn to read more critically, to address specific audiences
  for particular purposes, to construct effective arguments and narratives, and to
  use and cite source material properly. Students in these courses write a great deal;
  they prewrite, write, revise, and edit their work for content, clarity, tone, and
  grammar and receive detailed feedback from instructors and classmates. Assigned
  readings are related to the thematic focus of each course, and are used as demonstrations
  of writing techniques. The pieces in _Angles_ may be used as teaching tools and
  practical examples for other students and self-learners to emulate.
