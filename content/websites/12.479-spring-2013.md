course_description: 'The emphasis of this course is to use Trace Element Geochemistry
  to understand the origin and evolution of igneous rocks. The approach is to discuss
  the parameters that control partitioning of trace elements between phases and to
  develop models for the partitioning of trace elements between phases in igneous
  systems, especially between minerals and melt. Subsequently, published papers that
  are examples of utilizing Trace Element Geochemistry are read and discussed.
