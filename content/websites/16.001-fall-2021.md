course_description: This course presents fundamental principles and methods of materials
  and structures for aerospace engineering, and engineering analysis and design concepts
  applied to aerospace systems. The topics include statics; analysis of trusses; analysis
  of statically determinate and indeterminate systems; stress-strain behavior of materials;
  analysis of beam bending, buckling, and torsion; and material and structural failure,
  including plasticity, fracture, fatigue, and their physical causes. Experiential
  lab and aerospace system projects provide additional aerospace context.
