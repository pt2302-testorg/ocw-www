course_description: "Patrick Winston's _How to Speak_ talk has been an MIT tradition\
  \ for over 40 years. Offered every January during the\_Independent Activities Period\
  \ (IAP), usually to overflow crowds, the talk is intended to improve your speaking\
  \ ability in critical situations by teaching you a few heuristic rules. Professor\
  \ Winston's collection of rules is presented along with examples of their application\
  \ in job-interview talks, thesis defenses, oral examinations, and lectures.\n\n\
