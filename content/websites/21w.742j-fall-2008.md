course_description: 'In this course we will read essays, novels, memoirs, and graphic
  texts, and view documentary and experimental films and videos which explore race
  from the standpoint of the multiracial. Examining the varied work of multiracial
  authors and filmmakers such as Danzy Senna, Ruth Ozeki, Kip Fulbeck, James McBride
  and others, we will focus not on how multiracial people are seen or imagined by
  the dominant culture, but instead on how they represent themselves. How do these
  authors approach issues of family, community, nation, language and history? What
  can their work tell us about the complex interconnections between race, gender,
  class, sexuality, and citizenship? Is there a relationship between their experiences
  of multiraciality and a willingness to experiment with form and genre? In addressing
  these and other questions, we will endeavor to think and write more critically and
  creatively about race as a social category and a lived experience.
