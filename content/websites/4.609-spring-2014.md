course_description: 'Art museums are powerful and contested institutions. They are
  also innovative sites of architectural and artistic practice. From the exhibitionary
  complex of the nineteenth century to the experiential complex of today, this course
  investigates the art museum from historical and contemporary perspectives, striking
  a balance between theoretical investigation and case studies of recent exhibitions
  and museum buildings. Where and why did the concept of the public art museum emerge,
  and how have its functions changed over time? How do art museums continue to shape
  our definitions of what art is? How have they responded to recent critiques of the
  self-described ''universal'' museum and to claims for the ethical display of ill-gotten
  artifacts or the restitution of such objects as Greek vases and bronzes looted from
  Benin? And why is the Euro-American art museum so compelling a model that it has
  spread around the globe?


  To address these and other questions, we will also go behind the scenes. Visits
  to local museums and discussions with curators are an essential component of the
  course.
