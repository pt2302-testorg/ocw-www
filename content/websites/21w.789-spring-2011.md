course_description: 'Students work in small collaborative design teams to propose,
  build, and document a semester-long project focused on mobile applications for cell
  phones. Additional assignments include creating several small mobile applications
  such as context-aware mobile media capture and games. Students document their work
  through a series of written and oral proposals, progress reports, and final reports.
  This course covers the basics of J2ME and explores mobile imaging and media creation,
  GPS location, user-centered design, usability testing, and prototyping. Java experience
  is recommended.
