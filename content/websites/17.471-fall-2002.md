course_description: 'This course examines the problems and issues confronting American
  national security policymakers and the many factors that influence the policies
  that emerge. But this is not a course about "threats," military strategies, or the
  exercise of military power.


  What threatens those interests? How should the U.S. defend those interests? What
  kind of military should we build? Should the U.S. enter into alliances with other
  countries? Do we need a larger Navy? How much should we spend on weapons procurement?


  The course has four broad goals:


  *   to demonstrate that definitions of national security and the specification of
  vital interests are subjective and fluid and that they are as much functions of
  domestic politics as they are responses to international politics and "objective
  threats";

  *   to demonstrate that policy decisions involve complex tradeoffs among political,
  social, economic, military, legal, and ethical goals and values;

  *   to explore how the many organizations, institutions, and individuals that participate
  in American national security policymaking affect policy formulation, implementation,
  and outcomes; and

  *   to better understand the historical context, evolution, and linkages of national
  security problems and solutions.


  The course is organized along an historical time line. Beginning with the final
  days of World War II we follow American national security policy from the first
  stirrings of confrontation with the Soviet Union and China, into two hot wars in
  Asia that cost over 100,000 American lives and spawned social upheavals, through
  a close encounter with nuclear war, stumbling into the era of arms control, and
  conclude with the collapse of the communism. Selective case studies, memoirs, and
  original documents act as windows into each period. What were US national security
  decision makers thinking? What were they worried about? How did they see their options?
