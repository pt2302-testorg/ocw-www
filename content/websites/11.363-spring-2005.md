course_description: 'This graduate seminar examines civic engagement in international,
  national and local environmental governance. We will consider theories pertaining
  to civil society development, social movement mobilization, and the relations that
  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have with governments and corporations. During
  the course of the semester, particular attention will be given to the legitimacy
  and accountability of NGOs. Case studies of NGO and community responses to specific
  environmental issues will be used to illustrate theoretical issues and assess the
  impacts that these actors have on environmental policy and planning.
