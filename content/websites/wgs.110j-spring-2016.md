course_description: 'This course offers an introduction to the history of gender,
  sex, and sexuality in the modern United States, from the end of the nineteenth century
  to the beginning of the twenty-first. It begins with an overview of historical approaches
  to the field, emphasizing the changing nature of sexual and gender identities over
  time. The remainder of the course flows chronologically, tracing the expanding and
  contracting nature of attempts to control, construct, and contain sexual and gender
  identities, as well as the efforts of those who worked to resist, reject, and reform
  institutionalized heterosexuality and mainstream configurations of gendered power.
