course_description: 'This course provides an elementary introduction to probability
  and statistics with applications. Topics include: basic combinatorics, random variables,
  probability distributions, Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals,
  and linear regression.


  The Spring 2014 version of this subject employed the residential MITx system, which
  enables on-campus subjects to provide MIT students with learning and assessment
  tools such as online problem sets, lecture videos, reading questions, pre-lecture
  questions, problem set assistance, tutorial videos, exam review content, and even
  online exams.
