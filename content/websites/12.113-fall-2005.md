course_description: 'Structural geology is the study of processes and products of
  rock deformation. This course introduces the techniques of structural geology through
  a survey of the mechanics of rock deformation, a survey of the features and geometries
  of faults and folds, and techniques of strain analysis. Regional structural geology
  and tectonics are introduced. Class lectures are supplemented by lab exercises and
  demonstrations as well as field trips to local outcrops.
