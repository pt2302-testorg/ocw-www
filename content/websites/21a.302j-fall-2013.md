course_description: 'This course is an introduction to the cross-cultural study of
  biomedical ethics, examining moral foundations of the science and practice of Western
  biomedicine through case studies of abortion, contraception, cloning, organ transplantation
  and other issues. It evaluates challenges that new medical technologies pose to
  the practice and availability of medical services around the globe, and to cross-cultural
  ideas of kinship and personhood. Also discussed are critiques of the biomedical
  tradition from anthropological, feminist, legal, religious, and cross-cultural theorists.
