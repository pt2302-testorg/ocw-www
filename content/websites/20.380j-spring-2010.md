course_description: 'This course illustrates how knowledge and principles of biology,
  biochemistry, and engineering are integrated to create new products for societal
  benefit. It uses a case study format to examine recently developed products of pharmaceutical
  and biotechnology industries: how a product evolves from initial idea, through patents,
  testing, evaluation, production, and marketing. Emphasizes scientific and engineering
  principles; the responsibility scientists, engineers, and business executives have
  for the consequences of their technology; and instruction and practice in written
  and oral communication.


  The topic focus of this class will vary from year to year. This version looks at
  inflammation underlying many diseases, specifically its role in cancer, diabetes,
  and cardiovascular disease.
