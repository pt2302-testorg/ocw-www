course_description: 'This course covers the fundamental concepts that determine the
  electrical, optical, magnetic and mechanical properties of metals, semiconductors,
  ceramics and polymers. The roles of bonding, structure (crystalline, defect, energy
  band and microstructure) and composition in influencing and controlling physical
  properties are discussed. Also included are case studies drawn from a variety of
  applications: semiconductor diodes and optical detectors, sensors, thin films, biomaterials,
  composites and cellular materials, and others.
