course_description: "This subject focuses on the objects, history, context, and critical\
  \ discussion surrounding art since World War II. Because of the burgeoning increase\
  \ in art production, the course is necessarily selective. We will trace major developments\
  \ and movements in art up to the present, primarily from the US; but we will also\
  \ be looking at art from Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East,\
  \ as well as art \"on the margins\" \u2014 art that has been overlooked by the mainstream\
  \ critical press, but may have a broad cultural base in its own community. We will\
  \ ask what function art serves in its various cultures of origin, and why art has\
  \ been such a lightning rod for political issues around the world.\n"
