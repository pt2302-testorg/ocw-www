course_description: "Functional analysis helps us study and solve both linear and\
  \ nonlinear problems posed on a normed space that is no longer finite-dimensional,\
  \ a situation that arises very naturally in many concrete problems. Topics include\
  \ normed spaces, completeness, functionals, the Hahn-Banach Theorem, duality, operators;\
  \ Lebesgue measure, measurable functions, integrability, completeness of L\u1D56\
  \ spaces; Hilbert spaces; compact and self-adjoint operators; and the Spectral Theorem."
