course_description: "This subject is designed to inform students on the analytical\
  \ foundations of inviscid subsonic aerodynamics. A primary goal of this subject\
  \ is to equip students with the scientific rigor, applied mathematical complexity,\
  \ and physical understanding that form the foundation of classical subsonic aerodynamics.\
  \ Perturbation methods that both simplify mathematical complexity and expand physical\
  \ understanding of critical phenomenon in fluid flow provides a framework for the\
  \ subject. The subject offers lectures in classical subsonic aerodynamics at the\
  \ graduate level on inviscid, subsonic, steady flow over slender aerodynamic bodies.\
  \ Topics will be selected from: fundamentals of fluid mechanics \\[review\\]; singular-perturbation\
  \ methods \\[introduction, JIT\\]; similitude; subsonic flows with axial symmetry;\
  \ linearized subsonic flow; slender body theory; similarity rules for subsonic flows;\
  \ two-dimensional flow past a wave-shaped wall; thin wing theory; Kaplan\u2019s\
  \ higher approximations.\n"
