course_description: 'This course analyzes mainstream, popular films produced in the
  post-World War II 20th century U.S. as cultural texts that shed light on ongoing
  historical struggles over gender identity and appropriate sexual behaviors. It traces
  the history of LGBTQ/queer film through the 20th and into the 21st century. It also
  examines the effect of the Hollywood Production Code and censorship of sexual themes
  and content, and the subsequent subversion of queer cultural production in embedded
  codes and metaphors. In addition, this course also considers the significance of
  these films as artifacts and examples of various aspects of queer theory.
