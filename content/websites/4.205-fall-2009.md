course_description: 'The goal of this course is to investigate with students backgrounds
  on some of the pivotal events that have shaped our understanding and approach to
  architecture. Emphasis of discussion will be primarily on buildings and works of
  individual architects. Canonical architects, buildings and movements that have exerted
  significant influences on the development of architecture will be studied in detail.
  We will visit some of these buildings for a first-hand look and to evaluate for
  ourselves their significance or lack thereof. As a final project, each student will
  analyze a building through drawings, text, bibliography and a physical model in
  a format ready for documentation and exhibition.
