course_description: "This course immerses students in the process of building and\
  \ testing their own digital and board games in order to better understand how we\
  \ learn from games. We explore the design and use of games in the classroom in addition\
  \ to research and development issues associated with computer\u2013based (desktop\
  \ and handheld) and non\u2013computer\u2013based media. In developing their own\
  \ games, students examine what and how people learn from them (including field testing\
  \ of products), as well as how games can be implemented in educational settings.\n"
