course_description: "The course examines the earliest emergence of stories about King\
  \ Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in the context of the first wave of\
  \ British Imperialism and the expanded powers of the Catholic Church during the\
  \ twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The morphology of Arthurian romance will be\
  \ set off against original historical documents and chronicle sources for the English\
  \ conquests in Brittany, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland to understand the ways in\
  \ which these new attitudes towards Empire were being mythologized. Authors will\
  \ include Bede, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chr\xE9tien de Troyes, Marie de France, Gerald\
  \ of Wales, together with some lesser known works like the _Perilous Graveyard_,\
  \ _the_ _Knight\_with the Sword_, and _Perlesvaus_, or _the High History of the\
  \ Holy Graal_. Special attention will be paid to how the narrative material of the\
  \ story gets transformed according to the particular religious and political agendas\
  \ of each new author.\n"
