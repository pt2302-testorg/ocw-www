course_description: 'Inspired by the work of the architect Antoni Gaudi, this research
  workshop will explore three-dimensional problems in the static equilibrium of structural
  systems. Through an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and
  architecture, we will develop design tools for determining the form of three-dimensional
  structural systems under a variety of loads. The goal of the workshop is to develop
  real-time design and analysis tools which will be useful to architects and engineers
  in the form-finding of efficient three-dimensional structural systems.
