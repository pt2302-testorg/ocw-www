course_description: 'This course examines joint fact-finding within the context of
  adaptive and ecosystem-based management. Challenges and obstacles to collaborative
  approaches for deciding environmental and natural resource policy and the institutional
  changes within federal agencies necessary to utilize joint fact-finding as a means
  to link science and societal decisions are discussed and reviewed with scientists
  and managers. Senior-level federal policymakers also participate in these discussions.
