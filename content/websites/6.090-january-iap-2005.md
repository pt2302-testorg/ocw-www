course_description: 'This course will serve as a two-week aggressively gentle introduction
  to programming for those students who lack background in the field. Specifically
  targeted at students with little or no programming experience, the course seeks
  to reach students who intend to take [6.001](courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005)
  and feel they would struggle because they lack the necessary background. The main
  focus of the subject will be acquiring programming experience: instruction in programming
  fundamentals coupled with lots of practice problems. Lots of programming required,
  but lots of support provided.
