course_description: "6.720 examines the physics of microelectronic semiconductor devices\
  \ for silicon integrated circuit applications. Topics covered include: semiconductor\
  \ fundamentals, p-n junction, metal-oxide semiconductor structure, metal-semiconductor\
  \ junction, MOS field-effect transistor, and bipolar junction transistor. The course\
  \ emphasizes physical understanding of device operation through energy band diagrams\
  \ and short-channel MOSFET device design. Issues in modern device scaling are also\
  \ outlined. The course is worth 2 Engineering Design Points.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\
  ---------------\n\nProf. Jes\xFAs del Alamo would like to thank Prof. Harry Tuller\
  \ for his support of and help in teaching the course.\n"
