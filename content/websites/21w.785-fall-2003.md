course_description: 'This class covers the analysis, design, implementation and testing
  of various forms of digital communication based on group collaboration. Students
  are encouraged to think about the Web and other new digital interactive media not
  just in terms of technology but also broader issues such as language (verbal and
  visual), design, information architecture, communication and community. Students
  work in small groups on a semester-long project of their choice.
