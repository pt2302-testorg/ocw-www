course_description: 'Students will learn about the use of biomaterials to create advanced
  diagnostic tools for detection of infectious and chronic diseases, restore insulin
  production to supplement lost pancreatic function in diabetes, provide cells with
  appropriate physical, mechanical, and biochemical cues to direct tissue regeneration,
  and enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
