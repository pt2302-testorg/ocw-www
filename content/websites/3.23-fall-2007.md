course_description: 'This class discusses the origin of electrical, magnetic and optical
  properties of materials, with a focus on the acquisition of quantum mechanical tools.
  It begins with an analysis of the properties of materials, presentation of the postulates
  of quantum mechanics, and close examination of the hydrogen atom, simple molecules
  and bonds, and the behavior of electrons in solids and energy bands. Introducing
  the variation principle as a method for the calculation of wavefunctions, the course
  continues with investigation of how and why materials respond to different electrical,
  magnetic and electromagnetic fields and probes and study of the conductivity, dielectric
  function, and magnetic permeability in metals, semiconductors, and insulators. A
  survey of common devices such as transistors, magnetic storage media, optical fibers
  concludes the semester.


  Note: The Magnetics unit was taught by co-instructor David Paul; that material is
  not available at this time.
