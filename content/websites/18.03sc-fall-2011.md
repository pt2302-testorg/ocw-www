course_description: "The laws of nature are expressed as differential equations. Scientists\
  \ and engineers must know how to model the world in terms of differential equations,\
  \ and how to solve those equations and interpret the solutions. This course focuses\
  \ on the equations and techniques most useful in science and engineering.\n\nCourse\
  \ Format\n\nThis course has been designed for independent study. It provides everything\
  \ you will need to understand the concepts covered in the course. The materials\
  \ include:\n\n- **Lecture Videos** by Professor Arthur Mattuck.\n- **Course Notes**\
  \ on every topic.\n- **Practice Problems** with **Solutions**.\n- **Problem Solving\
  \ Videos** taught by experienced MIT Recitation Instructors.\n- **Problem Sets**\
  \ to do on your own with **Solutions** to check your answers against when you're\
  \ done.\n- A selection of **Interactive Java\xAE Demonstrations** called _Mathlets_\
  \ to illustrate key concepts.\n- A full set of **Exams with Solutions**, including\
  \ practice exams to help you prepare.\n\nContent Development\n\nHaynes Miller\_\
  \  \nJeremy Orloff\_  \nDr. John Lewis\_  \nArthur Mattuck"
