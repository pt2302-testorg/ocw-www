course_description: 'This course examines wave equations for fluid and visco-elastic
  media, wave-theory formulations of acoustic source radiation and seismo-acoustic
  propagation in stratified ocean waveguides, and Wavenumber Integration and Normal
  Mode methods for propagation in plane-stratified media. Also covered are Seismo-Acoustic
  modeling of seabeds and ice covers, seismic interface and surface waves in a stratified
  seabed, Parabolic Equation and Coupled Mode approaches to propagation in range-dependent
  ocean waveguides, numerical modeling of target scattering and reverberation clutter
  in ocean waveguides, and ocean ambient noise modeling. Students develop propagation
  models using all the numerical approaches relevant to state-of-the-art acoustic
  research.


  This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering)
  as 13.853. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department
  of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.068.
