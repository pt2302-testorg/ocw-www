course_description: 'The studio will focus on the district of Gaoming, located in
  the northwest of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) - the fastest growing and most productive
  region of China. The District has recently completed a planning effort in which
  several design institutes and a Hong Kong planning firm prepared ideas for a new
  central area near the river. The class will complement these efforts by focusing
  on planning and design options on the waterfront of the proposed new district and
  ways of integrating water/hydrological factors into all aspects and land uses of
  a modern city (residential, commercial, industrial) - including watershed and natural
  ecosystem protection, economic and recreational activities, transportation, and
  tourism.
