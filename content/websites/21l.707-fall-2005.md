course_description: 'This course focuses on the period between roughly 1550-1850.
  American ideas of race had taken on a certain shape by the middle of the nineteenth
  century, consolidated by legislation, economics, and the institution of chattel
  slavery. But both race and identity meant very different things three hundred years
  earlier, both in their dictionary definitions and in their social consequences.
  How did people constitute their identities in early America, and how did they speak
  about these identities? Texts will include travel writing, captivity narratives,
  orations, letters, and poems, by Native American, English, Anglo-American, African,
  and Afro-American writers.
