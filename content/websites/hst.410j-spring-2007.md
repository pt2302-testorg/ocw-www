course_description: 'This course is a project-based introduction to manipulating and
  characterizing cells and biological molecules using microfabricated tools. It is
  designed for first year undergraduate students. In the first half of the term, students
  perform laboratory exercises designed to introduce (1) the design, manufacture,
  and use of microfluidic channels, (2) techniques for sorting and manipulating cells
  and biomolecules, and (3) making quantitative measurements using optical detection
  and fluorescent labeling. In the second half of the term, students work in small
  groups to design and test a microfluidic device to solve a real-world problem of
  their choosing. Includes exercises in written and oral communication and team building.
