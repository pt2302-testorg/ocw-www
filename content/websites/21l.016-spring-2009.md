course_description: 'This class explores the creation (and creativity) of the modern
  scientific and cultural world through study of western Europe in the 17th century,
  the age of Descartes and Newton, Shakespeare, Milton and Ford. It compares period
  thinking to present-day debates about the scientific method, art, religion, and
  society. This team-taught, interdisciplinary subject draws on a wide range of literary,
  dramatic, historical, and scientific texts and images, and involves theatrical experimentation
  as well as reading, writing, researching and conversing.


  The primary theme of the class is to explore how England in the mid-seventeenth
  century became "a world turned upside down" by the new ideas and upheavals in religion,
  politics, and philosophy, ideas that would shape our modern world. Paying special
  attention to the "theatricality" of the new models and perspectives afforded by
  scientific experimentation, the class will read plays by Shakespeare, Tate, Brecht,
  Ford, Churchill, and Kushner, as well as primary and secondary texts from a wide
  range of disciplines. Students will also compose and perform in scenes based on
  that material.
