course_description: 'This course is designed to introduce students to fundamental
  issues and debates in the writing of history. It will feature innovative historical
  accounts written in recent years. The class will consider such questions as the
  words historians use, their language, sources, methods, organization, framing, and
  style. How does the choice of each of these affect the historian''s work? How does
  the author choose, analyze, and present evidence? How effective are different methodologies?
