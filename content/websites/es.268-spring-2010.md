course_description: 'We will explore the mathematical strategies behind popular games,
  toys, and puzzles. Topics covered will combine basic fundamentals of game theory,
  probability, group theory, and elementary programming concepts. Each week will consist
  of a lecture and discussion followed by game play to implement the concepts learned
  in class.
