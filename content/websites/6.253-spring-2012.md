course_description: 'This course will focus on fundamental subjects in convexity,
  duality, and convex optimization algorithms. The aim is to develop the core analytical
  and algorithmic issues of continuous optimization, duality, and saddle point theory
  using a handful of unifying principles that can be easily visualized and readily
  understood.
