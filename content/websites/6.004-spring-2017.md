course_description: 'This course introduces architecture of digital systems, emphasizing
  structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. It covers the topics
  including multilevel implementation strategies, definition of new primitives (e.g.,
  gates, instructions, procedures, processes) and their mechanization using lower-level
  elements. It also includes analysis of potential concurrency, precedence constraints
  and performance measures, pipelined and multidimensional systems, instruction set
  design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.
