course_description: "This course is an intensive introduction to the techniques of\
  \ experimental chemistry and gives first year students an opportunity to learn and\
  \ master the basic chemistry lab techniques for carrying out experiments. Students\
  \ who successfully complete the course and obtain a \"Competent Chemist\" (CC) or\
  \ \"Expert Experimentalist\" (EE) rating are likely to secure opportunities for\
  \ research work in a chemistry lab at MIT.\n\n##### Acknowledgements\n\nThe laboratory\
  \ manual and materials for this course were prepared by Dr. Katherine J. Franz and\
  \ Dr. Kevin M. Shea with the assistance of Professors Rick L. Danheiser and Timothy\
  \ M. Swager. Materials have been revised by Dr. J. Haseltine, Dr. Kevin M. Shea,\
