course_description: 'This string theory course focuses on holographic duality (also
  known as gauge / gravity duality or AdS / CFT) as a novel method of approaching
  and connecting a range of diverse subjects, including quantum gravity / black holes,
  QCD at extreme conditions, exotic condensed matter systems, and quantum information.
