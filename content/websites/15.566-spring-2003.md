  is driving change, creating opportunities and challenges. Leaders who don''t understand
  at least the fundamentals of information systems will be at a strategic disadvantage.

  current and future developments in information technology, and fundamental principles
  for the effective use of computer-based information systems. There will be a special
  emphasis on manufacturing. Information Systems topics that will be covered include
  networks and distributed computing, including the World Wide Web, hardware and operating
  systems, software development tools and processes, relational databases, security
  and cryptography, enterprise applications, B2B, the semantic web and electronic
  commerce. Sloan LFM students with an interest in Information Systems are encouraged
