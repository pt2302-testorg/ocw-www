course_description: 'This course provides ways to analyze manufacturing systems in
  terms of material flow and storage, information flow, capacities, and times and
  durations of events. Fundamental topics include probability, inventory and queuing
  models, optimization, and linear and dynamic systems. Factory planning and scheduling
  topics include flow planning, bottleneck characterization, buffer and batch-size
  analysis, and dynamic behavior of production systems.
