course_description: 'This course is an introduction to Islam from the perspective
  of media and sound studies, intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students.
  From the time of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam in its various manifestations has had
  a complex relationship with media. While much contemporary writing focuses on Islam
  _in_ the media, this course explores how many aspects of Islamic practice and thinking
  might be understood as media technologies that facilitate the inscription, storage
  and transmission of knowledge. Central questions include: How do Islam and media
  technologies relate? What kinds of practices of inscription and transmission characterize
  Islam in all its varieties across time and place? How might Islamic thought and
  practice be understood in light of databases, networks, and audiovisual sensation?
  Given the rich diversity in Islam historically and geographically, emphasis will
  be placed on these interconnected but divergent practices from the earliest revelations
  of the Qur''an to contemporary Islamist political movements, with geographies spanning
  from Indonesia to the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in Europe and North
  America. In addition to exploring these themes through reading and writing, students
  will be encouraged to complete course assignments and projects _in_ media, using
  audiovisual documentary or composition as a means of responding to the course themes.
