course_description: 'Cells, regardless of whether they are in an organ in the human
  body or a component of a bacterial colony, can sense the chemical composition of
  the environment, the presence of neighboring cells, and even the types of their
  neighboring cells. Depending on the identity of a cell and the information it receives
  from its environment, it can grow (increase in size), proliferate (make more cells),
  become quiescent (stop growing and dividing), differentiate (make different types
  of cells), or die. How cells achieve the astonishing feat of appropriately sensing
  and responding to their environment has been a major question in biology. In this
  course we will read and critically discuss the primary scientific literature with
  the goal of highlighting the basic principles of cell growth, adaptation, and differentiation.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
