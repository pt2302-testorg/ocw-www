course_description: 'This is a seminar course that explores the history of selected
  features of the physical environment of urban America. Among the features considered
  are parks, cemeteries, tenements, suburbs, zoos, skyscrapers, department stores,
  supermarkets, and amusement parks. The course gives students experience in working
  with primary documentation sources through its selection of readings and class discussions.
  Students then have the opportunity to apply this experience by researching their
  own historical questions and writing a term paper.
