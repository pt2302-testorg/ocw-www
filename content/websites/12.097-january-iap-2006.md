course_description: 'This is an undergraduate introductory laboratory subject in ocean
  chemistry and measurement. There are three main elements to the course: oceanic
  chemical sampling and analysis, instrumentation development for the ocean environment,
  and the larger field of ocean science.


  This course is offered through The [MIT/WHOI Joint Program](http://web.mit.edu/mit-whoi/www/).
  The MIT/WHOI Joint Program is one of the premier marine science graduate programs
  in the world. It draws on the complementary strengths and approaches of two great
  institutions: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole
  Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).
