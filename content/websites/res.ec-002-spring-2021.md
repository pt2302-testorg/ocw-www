course_description: "This course introduces effective techniques for conducting interviews\
  \ and is designed to help you develop and strengthen your skills as an interviewer.\

  \ take you past the basics and into best practices that incorporate the Lean Research\
  \ principles of rigor, relevance, respect, and right-size. The course focuses specifically\
  \ on conducting interviews in \u201Cthe field\u201D\u2014 contexts in which we may\
  \ be in an unfamiliar setting or culture, such as when traveling abroad or conducting\
  \ research in a place we haven\u2019t been before.\n\nThis course is part of the\
  \ [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library),\
  \ which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in the course\
  \ if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials\
