course_description: 'How do we sense hunger? How do we sense pain? What causes growth
  in our bodies? How are we protected from pathogens? The answer to many of these
  questions involves small polymers of amino acids known as peptides. Peptides are
  broadly used as signal molecules for intercellular communication in prokaryotes,
  plants, fungi, and animals. Peptide signals in animals include vast numbers of peptide
  hormones, growth factors and neuropeptides. In this course, we will learn about
  molecular bases of peptide signaling. In addition, peptides potentially can be used
  as potent broad-spectrum antibiotics and hence might define novel therapeutic agents.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
