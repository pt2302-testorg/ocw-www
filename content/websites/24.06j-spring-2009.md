course_description: "This course does not seek to provide answers to ethical questions.\
  \ Instead, the course hopes to teach students two things. First, how do you recognize\
  \ ethical or moral problems in science and medicine? When something does not feel\
  \ right (whether cloning, or failing to clone) \u2014 what exactly is the nature\
  \ of the discomfort? What kind of tensions and conflicts exist within biomedicine?\
  \ Second, how can you think productively about ethical and moral problems? What\
  \ processes create them? Why do people disagree about them? How can an understanding\
  \ of philosophy or history help resolve them? By the end of the course students\
  \ will hopefully have sophisticated and nuanced ideas about problems in bioethics,\
  \ even if they do not have comfortable answers.\n"
