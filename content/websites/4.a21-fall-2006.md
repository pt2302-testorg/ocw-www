course_description: 'The transition from high school and home to college and a new
  living environment can be a fascinating and interesting time, made all the more
  challenging and interesting by being at MIT. More than recording the first semester
  through a series of snapshots, this freshman seminar will attempt to teach photography
  as a method of seeing and a tool for better understanding new surroundings. Over
  the course of the semester, students will develop a body of work through a series
  of assignments, and then attempt to describe the conditions and emotions of their
  new environment in a cohesive final presentation.
