course_description: 'This course introduces the basic driving forces for electric
  current, fluid flow, and mass transport, plus their application to a variety of
  biological systems. Basic mathematical and engineering tools will be introduced,
  in the context of biology and physiology. Various electrokinetic phenomena are also
  considered as an example of coupled nature of chemical-electro-mechanical driving
  forces. Applications include transport in biological tissues and across membranes,
  manipulation of cells and biomolecules, and microfluidics.
