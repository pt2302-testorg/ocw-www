course_description: "This course\_will start with a survey of basic oxygen radical\
  \ biochemistry followed by a discussion of the mechanisms of action of cellular\
  \ as well as dietary antioxidants. After considering the normal physiological roles\
  \ of oxidants, we will examine the effects of elevated ROS and a failure of cellular\
  \ redox capacity on the rate of organismal and cellular aging as well as on the\
  \ onset and progression of several major diseases that are often age-related. Topics\
  \ will include ROS-induced effects on stem cell regeneration, insulin resistance,\
  \ heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. The role of antioxidants\
  \ in potential therapeutic strategies for modulating ROS levels will also be discussed.\n\
  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
