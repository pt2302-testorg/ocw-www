course_description: "The aim of this class is to introduce the exciting and often\
  \ under appreciated discoveries in RNA biology by exploring the diversity of RNAs\u2014\
  encompassing classical molecules such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs)\
  \ and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as well as newer species, such as microRNAs (miRNAs),\
  \ long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). For each new class\
  \ of RNA, we will evaluate the evidence for its existence as well as for its proposed\
  \ function. Students will develop both a deep understanding of the field of RNA\
  \ biology and the ability to critically assess new papers in this fast-paced field.\n\
  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
