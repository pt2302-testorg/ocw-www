course_description: 'This course is a graduate level introduction to automatic discourse
  processing. The emphasis will be on methods and models that have applicability to
  natural language and speech processing.


  The class will cover the following topics: discourse structure, models of coherence
  and cohesion, plan recognition algorithms, and text segmentation. We will study
  symbolic as well as machine learning methods for discourse analysis. We will also
  discuss the use of these methods in a variety of applications ranging from dialogue
  systems to automatic essay writing.


  This subject qualifies as an Artificial Intelligence and Applications concentration
  subject.
