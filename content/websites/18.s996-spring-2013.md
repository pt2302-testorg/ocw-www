course_description: 'The goal of this class is to prove that category theory is a
  powerful language for understanding and formalizing common scientific models. The
  power of the language will be tested by its ability to penetrate into taken-for-granted
  ideas, either by exposing existing weaknesses or flaws in our understanding, or
  by highlighting hidden commonalities across scientific fields.
