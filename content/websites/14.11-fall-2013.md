course_description: "We will apply insights from game theory to explain human social\
  \ behavior, focusing on novel applications which have heretofore been the realm\
  \ of psychologists and philosophers\u2014for example, why people speak indirectly,\
  \ in what sense beauty is socially constructed, and where our moral intuitions come\
  \ from\u2014and eschewing traditional economic applications such as industrial organization\
  \ or auctions.\n\nWe will employ standard games such as the prisoners dilemma, coordination,\
  \ hawk-dove, and costly signaling, and use standard game theory tools such as Nash\
  \ Equilibria, Subgame Perfection, and Perfect Bayesian Equilibria. These tools will\
  \ be taught from scratch and no existing knowledge of game theory, economics, or\
  \ mathematics is required. At the same time, students familiar with these games\
  \ and tools will not find the course redundant because of the focus on non-orthodox\
  \ applications.\n"
