course_description: 'This course introduces students to the spatial, legal, economic,
  social and political structures that created apartheid in South Africa, and to the
  factors that led to the collapse of the racist order. We will examine the many forms
  of Black oppression and, also, the various forms of resistance to apartheid. Some
  of the themes we will explore include industrialization and the formation of the
  Black working classes; the constructions of race, ethnicities, and sexualities;
  land alienation and rural struggles; township poverty and violence; Black education;
  the African National Congress; and the Black Consciousness Movement.
