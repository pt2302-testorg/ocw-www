course_description: 'This course is designed to provide an understanding of how the
  human brain works in health and disease, and is intended for both the Brain and
  Cognitive Sciences major and the non-Brain and Cognitive Sciences major. Knowledge
  of how the human brain works is important for all citizens, and the lessons to be
  learned have enormous implications for public policy makers and educators.


  The course will cover the regional anatomy of the brain and provide an introduction
  to the cellular function of neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters. Commonly used
  drugs that alter brain function can be understood through a knowledge of neurotransmitters.
  Along similar lines, common diseases that illustrate normal brain function will
  be discussed. Experimental animal studies that reveal how the brain works will be
  reviewed.


  Throughout the seminar we will discuss clinical cases from Dr. Byrne''s experience
  that illustrate brain function; in addition, articles from the scientific literature
  will be discussed in each class.
