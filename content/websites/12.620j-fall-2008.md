course_description: "We will study the fundamental principles of classical mechanics,\
  \ with a modern emphasis on the qualitative structure of phase space. We will use\
  \ computational ideas to formulate the principles of mechanics precisely. Expression\
  \ in a computational framework encourages clear thinking and active exploration.\n\
  \nWe will consider the following topics: the Lagrangian formulation; action, variational\
  \ principles, and equations of motion; Hamilton's principle; conserved quantities;\
  \ rigid bodies and tops; Hamiltonian formulation and canonical equations; surfaces\
  \ of section; chaos; canonical transformations and generating functions; Liouville's\
  \ theorem and Poincar\xE9 integral invariants; Poincar\xE9-Birkhoff and KAM theorems;\
  \ invariant curves and cantori; nonlinear resonances; resonance overlap and transition\
  \ to chaos; properties of chaotic motion.\n\nIdeas will be illustrated and supported\
  \ with physical examples. We will make extensive use of computing to capture methods,\
  \ for simulation, and for symbolic analysis.\n"
