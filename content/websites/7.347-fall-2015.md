course_description: 'In this course, we will examine how the immune system acts to
  destroy pathogenic invaders while tolerating colonization by necessary commensal
  bacteria. As a counterpoint, we will also explore sophisticated strategies that
  help some bacteria evade our immune system.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
