course_description: 'This course will expose students to tools and methods of analysis
  for use in assessing the challenges and dangers associated with nuclear weapons
  in international politics. The first two weeks of the course will look at the technology
  and design of nuclear weapons and their means of production. The next five weeks
  will look at the role they played in the Cold War, the organizations that managed
  them, the technologies that were developed to deliver them, and the methods used
  to analyze nuclear force structures and model nuclear exchanges. The last six weeks
  of the course will look at theories and cases of nuclear decision making beyond
  the original five weapon states, and will look particularly at why states pursue
  or forego nuclear weapons, the role that individuals and institutions play, and
  the potential for both new sources of proliferation and new consequences.
