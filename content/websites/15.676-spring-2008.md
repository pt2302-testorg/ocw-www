course_description: "This seminar will cover the multi-disciplinary theoretical and\
  \ empirical foundations of research on work, employment, labor markets, and industrial\
  \ relations. We begin by tracing the historical development of theory and research\
  \ in the field, paying special attention to how the normative premises, concepts,\
  \ and methodological traditions of industrial relations compare to those of other\
  \ disciplines that contribute to the study of work and employment relations. Then\
  \ we will review a number of current theoretical and policy debates shaping the\
  \ field. This will be followed by a series of modules introducing different disciplinary\
  \ perspectives used to study work and employment issues today. Emphasis will be\
  \ given to recent research from different industries that illustrate the mix of\
  \ methods\u2014field work, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis,\
  \ etc.\u2014we encourage in this field of study.\n"
