course_description: 'This course was developed in 1987 by the MIT Center for Advanced
  Engineering Studies. It was designed as a distance-education course for engineers
  and scientists in the workplace.


  Advances in integrated circuit technology have had a major impact on the technical
  areas to which digital signal processing techniques and hardware are being applied.
  A thorough understanding of digital signal processing fundamentals and techniques
  is essential for anyone whose work is concerned with signal processing applications.


  Digital Signal Processing begins with a discussion of the analysis and representation
  of discrete-time signal systems, including discrete-time convolution, difference
  equations, the z-transform, and the discrete-time Fourier transform. Emphasis is
  placed on the similarities and distinctions between discrete-time. The course proceeds
  to cover digital network and nonrecursive (finite impulse response) digital filters.
  Digital Signal Processing concludes with digital filter design and a discussion
  of the fast Fourier transform algorithm for computation of the discrete Fourier
  transform.
