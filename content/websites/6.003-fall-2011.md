course_description: '6.003 covers the fundamentals of signal and system analysis,
  focusing on representations of discrete-time and continuous-time signals (singularity
  functions, complex exponentials and geometrics, Fourier representations, Laplace
  and Z transforms, sampling) and representations of linear, time-invariant systems
  (difference and differential equations, block diagrams, system functions, poles
  and zeros, convolution, impulse and step responses, frequency responses). Applications
  are drawn broadly from engineering and physics, including feedback and control,
  communications, and signal processing.
