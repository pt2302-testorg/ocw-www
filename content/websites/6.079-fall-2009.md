course_description: 'This course aims to give students the tools and training to recognize
  convex optimization problems that arise in scientific and engineering applications,
  presenting the basic theory, and concentrating on modeling aspects and results that
  are useful in applications. Topics include convex sets, convex functions, optimization
  problems, least-squares, linear and quadratic programs, semidefinite programming,
  optimality conditions, and duality theory. Applications to signal processing, control,
  machine learning, finance, digital and analog circuit design, computational geometry,
  statistics, and mechanical engineering are presented. Students complete hands-on
  exercises using high-level numerical software.
