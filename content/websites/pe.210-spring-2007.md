course_description: 'This course will thoroughly educate the successful student with
  the knowledge and skills necessary to be a certified beginning SCUBA diver. The
  prerequisite for the course is passing the MIT SCUBA swim test and demonstrating
  a "comfort level" in the water. At the end of the class, students will attempt to
  pass the certification exam to become certified divers. The class is taught in two
  parts each week: a classroom session and a pool session. The classroom sessions
  along with the reading material will provide the student with the knowledge necessary
  to pass the written exam. At the pool, the water skills are taught in progressions
  that build on the previous skills, making the difficult skills seem easy.'
