course_description: 'Infectious diseases represent a serious global public health
  problem. They have the potential to kill millions of people, whether they emerge
  naturally as outbreaks or pandemics, or deliberately through bioterrorism. Some
  examples of diseases caused by emerging pathogens are the Bubonic Plague, Toxoplasmosis,
  African Sleeping Sickness, and Chagas Disease. Each day, infectious disease scientists
  serve on the front lines protecting us from such threats. In this course students
  will learn how to design and critique experiments through the discussion of primary
  research articles that explore the molecular basis of disease caused by emerging
  pathogens.


  This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students
  with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about
  current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of
  the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest
  in teaching.
