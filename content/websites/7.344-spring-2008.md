course_description: "Directed evolution has been used to produce enzymes with many\
  \ unique properties. The technique of directed evolution comprises two essential\
  \ steps: mutagenesis of the gene encoding the enzyme to produce a library of variants,\
  \ and selection of a particular variant based on its desirable catalytic properties.\
  \ In this course we will examine what kinds of enzymes are worth evolving and the\
  \ strategies used for library generation and enzyme selection. We will focus on\
  \ those enzymes that are used in the synthesis of drugs and in biotechnological\
  \ applications.\n\nThis course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\_\
  offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching.\n"
