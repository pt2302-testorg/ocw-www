course_description: "Tracing the evolution of international interactions, this course\
  \ examines the dimensions of globalization in terms of scale and scope. It is divided\
  \ into three parts; together they are intended to provide theoretical, empirical,\
  \ and policy perspectives on source and consequences of globalization, focusing\
  \ on emergent structures and processes, and on the implications of flows of goods\
  \ and services across national boundaries \u2013 with special attention to the issue\
  \ of migration, on the assumption that people matter and matter a lot. An important\
  \ concern addressed pertains to the dilemmas of international policies that are\
  \ shaped by the macro-level consequences of micro-level behavior. 17.411 fulfills\
  \ undergraduate public policy requirement in the major and minor. Graduate students\
  \ are expected to explore the subject in greater depth through reading and individual\
  \ research.\n"
