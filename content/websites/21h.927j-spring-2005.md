course_description: 'This course will explore the relation of women and men in both
  pre-industrial and modern societies to the changing map of public and private (household)
  work spaces, examining how that map affected their opportunities for both productive
  activity and the consumption of goods and leisure. The reproductive strategies of
  women, either in conjunction with or in opposition to their families, will be the
  third major theme of the course. We will consider how a place and an ideal of the
  "domestic" arose in the early modern west, to what extent it was effective in limiting
  the economic position of women, and how it has been challenged, and with what success,
  in the post-industrial period. Finally, we will consider some of the policy implications
  for contemporary societies as they respond to changes in the composition of the
  paid work force, as well as to radical changes in their national demographic profiles.
  Although most of the material for the course will focus on western Europe since
  the Middle Ages and on the United States, we will also consider how these issues
  have played themselves out in non-western cultures.
