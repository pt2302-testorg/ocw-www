course_description: 'This course focuses on the algorithms for analyzing and designing
  geometric foldings. Topics include reconfiguration of foldable structures, linkages
  made from one-dimensional rods connected by hinges, folding two-dimensional paper
  (origami), and unfolding and folding three-dimensional polyhedra. Applications to
  architecture, robotics, manufacturing, and biology are also covered in this course.
