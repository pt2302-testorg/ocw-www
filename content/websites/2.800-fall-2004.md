course_description: 'This course addresses the design of tribological systems: the
  interfaces between two or more bodies in relative motion. Fundamental topics include:
  geometric, chemical, and physical characterization of surfaces; friction and wear
  mechanisms for metals, polymers, and ceramics, including abrasive wear, delamination
  theory, tool wear, erosive wear, wear of polymers and composites; and boundary lubrication
  and solid-film lubrication. The course also considers the relationship between nano-tribology
  and macro-tribology, rolling contacts, tribological problems in magnetic recording
  and electrical contacts, and monitoring and diagnosis of friction and wear. Case
  studies are used to illustrate key points.
