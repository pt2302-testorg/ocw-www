course_description: 'Foundations and philosophical applications of Bayesian decision
  theory, game theory and theory of collective choice. Why should degrees of belief
  be probabilities? Is it always rational to maximize expected utility? If so, why
  and what is its utility? What is a solution to a game? What does a game-theoretic
  solution concept such as Nash equilibrium say about how rational players will, or
  should, act in a game? How are the values and the actions of groups, institutions
  and societies related to the values and actions of the individuals that constitute
  them?
