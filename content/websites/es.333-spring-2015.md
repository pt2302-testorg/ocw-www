  communication that is situated in the production of educational videos; the assignments
  are all focused on the production of videos that teach some aspect of MIT''s first-year

  ability and communication habits; these improvements are effected by providing participants
  with instruction, practice, feedback, and the opportunity for reflection. In addition
  to improvements in communication skills, improvement is expected in students'' attitude
  towards writing, oral presentations, and collaboration; as the semester progresses,
  students should feel confident of their ability to write, present, and collaborate.
