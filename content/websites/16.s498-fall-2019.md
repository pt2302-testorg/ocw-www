course_description: 'In this course, [Dr. Ashkan Jasour](http://jasour.mit.edu/) addresses
  advanced probabilistic and robust optimization-based techniques for control and
  safety verification of nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of uncertainties.
  Specifically, we will learn how to leverage rigorous mathematical tools, such as
  the theory of measures and moments, the theory of nonnegative polynomials, and semidefinite
  programming, to develop convex optimization formulations to control and analyze
  uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems with applications in autonomous systems and
  robotics.
