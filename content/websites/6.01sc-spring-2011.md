course_description: "This course provides an integrated introduction to electrical\
  \ engineering and computer science, taught using substantial laboratory experiments\
  \ with mobile robots. Our primary goal is for you to learn to appreciate and use\
  \ the fundamental design principles of modularity and abstraction in a variety of\
  \ contexts from electrical engineering and computer science.\n\nOur second goal\
  \ is to show you that making mathematical models of real systems can help in the\
  \ design and analysis of those systems. Finally, we have the more typical goals\
  \ of teaching exciting and important basic material from electrical engineering\
  \ and computer science, including modern software engineering, linear systems analysis,\
  \ electronic circuits, and decision-making.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis course has\
  \ been designed for independent study. It includes all of the materials you will\
  \ need to understand the concepts covered in this subject. The materials in this\
  \ course include:\n\n- Lecture videos from Spring 2011, taught by Prof. Dennis Freeman\n\
  - Recitation videos, developed for OCW Scholar by teaching assistant Kendra Pugh\n\
  - Course notes\n- Software and design labs\n- Homework assignments and additional\
  \ exercises\n- Nano-quizzes and exams with solutions\n\nContent Development\n\n\
