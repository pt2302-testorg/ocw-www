course_description: 'This course is a detailed technical and historical exploration
  of the Apollo project to "fly humans to the moon and return them safely to earth"
  as an example of a complex engineering system. Emphasis is on how the systems worked,
  the technical and social processes that produced them, mission operations, and historical
  significance. Guest lectures are featured by MIT-affiliated engineers who contributed
  to and participated in the Apollo missions. Students work in teams on a final project
  analyzing an aspect of the historical project to articulate and synthesize ideas
  in engineering systems.
