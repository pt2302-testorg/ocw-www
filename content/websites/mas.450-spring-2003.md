course_description: 'MAS.450 is a laboratory course about holography and holographic
  imaging.


  This course teaches holography from a scientific and analytical point of view, moving
  from interference and diffraction to imaging of single points to the display of
  three-dimensional images. Using a "hands-on" approach, students explore the underlying
  physical phenomena that make holograms work, as well as designing laboratory setups
  to make their own images. The course also teaches mathematical techniques that allow
  the behavior of holography to be understood, predicted, and harnessed.


  Holography today brings together the fields of optics, chemistry, computer science,
  electrical engineering, visualization, three-dimensional display, and human perception
  in a unique and comprehensive way. As such, MAS.450 offers interesting and useful
  exposure to a wide range of principles and ideas. As a course satisfying the Institute
  Laboratory Requirement, MAS.450 teaches about science, scientific research, and
  the scientific method through observation and exploration, hinting at the excitement
  that inventors feel before they put their final equations to paper.
