course_description: "A whirl-wind tour of the statistics used in behavioral science\
  \ research, covering topics including: data visualization, building your own null-hypothesis\
  \ distribution through permutation, useful parametric distributions, the generalized\
  \ linear model, and model-based analyses more generally. Familiarity with MATLAB\xAE\
  , Octave, or R will be useful, prior experience with statistics will be helpful\
  \ but is not essential. This course is intended to be a ground-up sketch of a coherent,\
  \ alternative perspective to the \"null-hypothesis significance testing\" method\
  \ for behavioral research (but don't worry if you don't know what this means).\n"
