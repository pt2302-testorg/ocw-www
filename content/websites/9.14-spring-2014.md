course_description: 'This course provides an outline of vertebrate functional neuroanatomy,
  aided by studies of comparative neuroanatomy and evolution, and by studies of brain
  development. Topics include early steps to a central nervous system, basic patterns
  of brain and spinal cord connections, regional development and differentiation,
  regeneration, motor and sensory pathways and structures, systems underlying motivations,
  innate action patterns, formation of habits, and various cognitive functions. In
  addition, lab techniques are reviewed and students perform brain dissections.
