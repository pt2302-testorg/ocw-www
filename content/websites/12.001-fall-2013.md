course_description: "Geology is the core discipline of the earth sciences and encompasses\
  \ many different phenomena, including plate tectonics and mountain building, volcanoes\
  \ and earthquakes, and the long-term evolution of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, surface\
  \ and life. Because of the ever-increasing demand for resources, the growing exposure\
  \ to natural hazards, and the changing climate, geology is of considerable societal\
  \ relevance. This course introduces students to the basics of geology. Through a\
  \ combination of lectures, labs, and field observations, we will address topics\
  \ ranging from mineral and rock identification to the origin of the continents,\
  \ from geologic mapping to plate tectonics, and from erosion by rivers and glaciers\
  \ to the history of life.\n"
