description: OCW Scholar courses are designed for independent learners who have few
  additional resources available to them. The courses are substantially more complete
  than typical OCW courses and include new custom-created content as well as materials
  repurposed from MIT classrooms. The materials are also arranged in logical sequences
  and include multimedia such as video and simulations.
