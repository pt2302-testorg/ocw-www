description: "The MIT Open Learning Library is home to selected educational content\
  \ from MIT OpenCourseWare and [MITx courses](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx), available\
  \ for free to anyone in the world at any time.\_\n\n**How MIT Open Learning Library\
  \ Differs from MIT OpenCourseWare and MITx on edX**\n\nYou can think of OCW, MITx,\
  \ and Open Learning Library along a spectrum of learning scenarios, presenting content\
  \ in different formats to meet different learner needs.\_\n\n- **MITx courses**\
  \ are end-to-end course experiences with optional certificates available for you\
  \ to earn, live teaching support and interaction with other learners in discussion\
  \ forums, and start and end dates.\n- **MIT OpenCourseWare** offers a completely\
  \ self-guided experience with published content from MIT courses that is open all\
  \ of the time and licensed for download, remix, and reuse, but does not offer certificates\
  \ nor interaction with teachers and learners.\_\n- **MIT Open Learning Library**\
  \ sits in between MITx and OCW. As in many MITx courses, Open Learning Library provides\
  \ interactive course experiences that include auto-graded assessments that give\
  \ you instant feedback and allow you to track your progress as you work your way\
  \ through the subject matter. And like OCW, this content is always open and self-guided\
  \ and includes no live support, discussion forum, or certificates.\n\nMIT is committed\
  \ to sharing learning materials with the world. The Open Learning Library provides\
  \ additional opportunities to learn from MIT at your own pace, engaging with interactive\
  \ problems and receiving instant feedback.\n\n**Interactive Assessments and Progress\
  \ Tracking**\n\nYou can view and use all Open Learning Library materials without\
  \ enrolling ([learn more here](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library)).\_\
  \n\nIf you want to track your progress through a course, create a free Open Learning\
  \ Library account, and then enroll in the course. The learning experience will be\
  \ similar to [MITx courses](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/mitx-courses)\
  \ running on edX and MITx Online platforms. However,\_Open Learning Library does\
  \ not include discussion forums, certificates, or the ability to transfer your progress\
  \ to an active MITx course.\_\n\nOpen Learning Library resources designated as OCW\
  \ content are free to download, remix, and reuse for non-commercial purposes.\_\
  \ Resources designated as MITx content have varying licenses: some are All Rights\
  \ Reserved, others Creative Commons, and some have mixed licenses. You will see\
  \ the license type indicated on the About Pages."
