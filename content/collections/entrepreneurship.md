  \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology has always been associated with major scientific\
  \ and technological breakthroughs. But the breakthroughs alone do not explain the\
  \ impact that MIT has had on the world. For that we have to look at entrepreneurship,\
  \ which starts with the \"Mens et Manus\" (Mind and Hand) slogan on the Great Seal\
  \ of MIT. For faculty, students, and alumni, MIT is all about making discoveries\
  \ and inventions and then applying these discoveries and inventions to solve real\
  \ problems. In a very tangible way, MIT faculty and graduates invent the future,\
  \ and entrepreneurship\u2014the building of new businesses\u2014is often the road\
  \ to that future.\_\n\n[Watch this video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkDqpBctfA)\
  \ to entrepreneurship at MIT.\n\nThe report \u201C[Entrepreneurship and Innovation\
  \ at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf)\u201D examines the\
  \ impact of MIT graduates who have founded and built for-profit companies. The report\
  \ estimates that, as of 2014, living MIT alumni have launched more than 30,000 active\
  \ companies, creating some 4.6 million jobs and generating $1.9 trillion in annual\
  \ revenue. The cumulative result is the equivalent of the 10th largest economy in\
  \ the world. This rich legacy of high-impact companies spans a wide range of industries;\
  \ recent examples include A123 Systems, Akamai, iRobot, InVivo Therapeutics and\
  \ Dropbox.\n\nThe following courses represent a selection of the entrepreneurship-related\
  \ courses offered at MIT. The courses are organized in two ways: **Core courses**,\
  \ the starting points for entrepreneurs and **Supplemental courses**, important\
  \ once the basics have been mastered\n\nThose interested in a general introduction\
  \ to entrepreneurship as taught at MIT should visit [*15.390 New Enterprises*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-390-new-enterprises-spring-2013)\
