  \nSeeking to understand and transform the world\u2019s energy systems, MIT researchers\
  \ and students investigate all aspects of energy. They discover new ways of generating\
  \ and storing energy, as in creating biofuels from plant waste and in holding electricity\
  \ from renewable sources in cost-effective, high-capacity batteries. They create\
  \ models and design experiments to determine how we can improve energy efficiency\
  \ at all scales, from nanostructures and photovoltaic cells to large power plants\
  \ and smart electrical grids. They analyze how people make decisions about energy,\
  \ whether as individual consumers or whole nations, and they forecast what the social\
  \ and environmental consequences of these decisions might be. \_\n\nIn fact, the\
  \ study of energy is so important and so pervasive at MIT, the [MIT Energy Initiative](http://energy.mit.edu/)\
  \ has devised an undergraduate\_[Energy Studies Minor](https://energy.mit.edu/education/undergraduate/minor/)\_\
  which\_develops the expertise needed to reshape how the world uses energy. The Energy\
  \ Studies Minor consists of a\_core\_of foundational subjects, complemented by a\
  \ choice of\_electives\_which allow students to tailor their Energy Minor to\_their\
  \ particular interests.\n\nMany of the Energy Minor subjects are represented on\
  \ OCW, and listed below. In addition to its core and elective courses, some\_other\
  \ energy courses\_which are not officially part of the Energy Minor program are\
  \ also listed."
