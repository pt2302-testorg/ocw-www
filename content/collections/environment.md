description: "Photo license: CC Zero (public domain)\n\nLike so many of the big challenges\
  \ taken on at MIT, environmental and sustainability issues demand an interdisciplinary\
  \ perspective.\n\nFrom declining fisheries to acute urban pollution to record-breaking\
  \ global temperatures, the evidence of human impact on the environment continues\
  \ to mount. And at the same time, the environment shapes us, as human society and\
  \ institutions are built upon our connection to the weather, land, water, and other\
  \ species. What can we learn from ecological systems and cycles? What solutions\
  \ will allow people and the planet to thrive?\_\n\nMIT scholars, students and alumni\
  \ are working to understand and help us make progress toward a more sustainable\
  \ and just world. This core mission draws upon all of the fields represented at\
  \ MIT: not just science, engineering, and technology, but also the humanities, arts,\
  \ economics, history, architecture, urban planning, management, policy, and more.\n\
  \nThis OCW course collection is inspired by two interdisciplinary MIT programs.\
  \ Many of the undergraduate courses fall within the [undergraduate Environment and\
  \ Sustainability Minor](http://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/environment-sustainability-minor/)\
  \ managed by MIT\u2019s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI); the OCW course\
  \ list employs the undergraduate minor\u2019s four topic pillars. Many of the graduate-level\
  \ courses are part of the\_[MIT Sloan School of Management Sustainability Certificate](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate)\
  \ curriculum.\n\nAlso check out the [MIT Climate Portal](https://climate.mit.edu)\
  \ for many other Creative Commons-licensed open educational resources on climate\
  \ change, including brief Explainer articles on key topics and the award-winning\
  \ TILClimate podcast with educator guides."
